EPM (the Educational Problem Manager) is intended to
make it easier for one user to develop a programming
problem and then make it available for other users to
solve.  Problem development is mostly a matter of
creating test case input and output in a form suitable
for automatic scoring, and then debugging the problem
solution and specification against the test cases.

For an introductory guide and full user documentation
see the `intro' subdirectory.
