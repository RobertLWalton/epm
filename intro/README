This directory contains PDF files that are NOT part
of an EPM installation, because they are printouts
of HTML files that are part of the installation and
can be printed from the installation.

This directory is provided for online reference when
an EPM installation is not available.

The PDF files in this directory may be a bit out of
date, as they are not automatically maintained.
Nevertheless, they should allow the reader to get
a good sense of EPM.  Up-to-date printouts can
be obtained by printing the Guide and/or Help
pages of an EPM installation.
