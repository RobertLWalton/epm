EPM (the Educational Problem Manager) is intended to
make it easier for one user to develop a programming problem and
then make it available for other users to solve.
Problem development is mostly a matter of creating
test case input and output in a form suitable for automatic
scoring, and then debugging the problem solution and specification
against the test cases.

<p>
To open an account, all you need is an e-mail address.
Open a tab using the URL of the EPM server you want to access,
and enter your e-mail address.
<p>
You will be e-mailed a confirmation number which you must
enter into your browser.  The browser will then be given
a `ticket' valid for 7 days, provided you enter the
additional information required to establish a new account.
<p>
Note that most of this additional information will be visible to other
users of the EPM server.  The exception is the non-domain
part of your e-mail addresses, which will NOT be visible.
<p>
After you have logged in, go to the Project Page.  When
you log in the next time, you will be automatically sent
to the Project Page.
<p>
The buttons marked ? access the Help Page, which has
detailed documentation for various pages and parts of pages.
</p>

<a name="solving-a-problem"><h1>Solving a Problem</h1></a>
<p>
To solve a problem, you first want to `pull' the problem
from a project.  Go to the Project Page and select
the problem list you want to pull the problem from.
For example, select `demos Problems'.  Then click the
`Pull' button.
<p>
Next click the oval of the problem you want to pull.
For example, click the `reverser' oval, which will turn
black.  Next click the `Submit' button.  The black oval
should turn green indicating success, and `Done!' should
appear.
<p>
Now go back to the Project page and select the `Your Problems'
problem list.  This was empty but now has `reverser' in it.
In the `Create Tab for Problem' selector, select `reverser'.
A new `reverser Problem Page' tab will be created.  You now
have two tabs, the one just created and the original
`Project Page' tab.
<p>
Go to the `reverser Problem Page' tab and click on `reverser.pdf'
to see the problem specification.
<p>
You can write your own solution, or you can click on
`Downloads' to get a window with demos problems solutions of
various kinds.  You need to get a solution on your own
computer, at which point you use `Upload a File' to
upload the solution to your reverser problem.  When it is uploaded
it is compiled, and if there are compilation errors, error
messages will be displayed and the solution will NOT
be entered into your EPM problem directory.
If there are no errors, your solution and its executable
file will be entered into your problem directory, or
`kept'.
<p>
You can see more detail about what happened during the
compilation by clicking the downward arrow buttons
on the `Commands Last Executed' and `Working Files ...'
sections.  Working files are files output by the commands
that were NOT kept, and are more likely to be of interest when
the commands fail and there are no kept files.
<p>
Each file in your problem directory has a line in the
`Current Problem Files' section of the Project Page,
and each working file from the last executed command has
a line in the `Working Files ...' section.
After a set of commands execute, one or two files, either
kept or working,
are automatically shown, but you can show
any of your problem directory files or working files that
are ASCII text or pdf by clicking either the file name if
it is a button, or the downward arrow after the file name.
An exception is a very short one-line file whose entire contents is displayed
in { } brackets at the end of its line.
<p>
Lines for files with names of the form `00-*-reverser.in'
are inputs for sample test cases.  If you click on the
`=>.score' button for such a line, the score of the
test case will be computed in the `00-*-reverser.score'
file.
<p>
In general the operations you perform consists of
making one file from another file, and typically the two
file names are identical but for their extensions.
In addition to making the .score file you can also make
a .sin solution input file, a .sout solution output file,
and a .fout filtered solution output file.  For the
`reverser' problem
the .sin file is identical to the .in file with comments
removed, and the .fout file is identical to the .sout file.
<p>
After the scores for the sample test cases are all
`Completely Correct', the problem can be submitted by
going to the `Run Page'. On this page if you click
on the `Run' button of the `sample-reverser.run' line
all the sample test cases will be run and the result
will be placed in the `sample-reverser.rout' (run output)
file.  If instead you click on the `Submit' button
on the `submit-reverser.run' line, all the test cases,
including the hidden judge' test cases with names
of the form `01-*-reverser.in', will be run and the
total result will be displayed in the `submit-reverser.rout'
file.
<p>
If there is an error in a test case during a `Submit',
the test case .in and .fout files will be linked into
your Problems Page so you can debug the test case as
you would a sample test case.
<p>
If you have downloaded a solution from the `Downloads Page',
you may wish to use it to see what happens when a solution
has errors.  If you look at a `reverser' solution, you will see that
it has a section where different types of errors
can be easily introduced either by defining a single macro
or by changing the value of a single variable.  If you use
this to introduce an error in the solution, then you can
try using the erroneous solution to produce
`.score' files on the `reverser Problem Page' or `.rout' files
on the `reverser Run Page'.
<p>
More detailed information is available in the Help Page
accessed by the `?' buttons.
