<a name="introductory-note"><h1>Introductory Note</h1></a>
<p>
EPM (the Educational Problem Manager) is intended to
make it easier for one user to develop a programming problem and
then make it available for other users to solve.
Problem development is mostly a matter of creating
test case input and output in a form suitable for automatic
scoring, and then debugging the problem solution and specification
against the test cases.
<p>
The following diagram specifies the data flow used to score
a test case for a problem named PPPP.  For simple problems,
generate-PPPP simply copies its input to its output removing
comments, and filter-PPPP simply copies its input to its
output (epm_score ignores comments).  In more complex cases
generate-PPPP uses commands from the .in file to generate
.sin solution input using a pseudo-random number generator,
and filter-PPPP analyzes the .sin and .sout files to produce
a summary used in scoring (e.g., it might read a graph from .sin
and check that a path in .sout is in fact a path in the graph,
outputting the path length if it is and an error message otherwise).

To open an account, all you need is an e-mail address.
Open a tab using the URL of the EPM server you want to access,
and enter your e-mail address.
<p>
You will be e-mailed a confirmation number which you must
enter into your browser.  An auto-login period of 2 days
is started when you enter the confirmation number and provide
the additional information required to establish a new account.
At the end of each auto-login period another confirmation
number is sent when you next log in.  The first auto-log
period is 2 days, the second 7 days, and all others 30 days.

<p>
Note that most of the additional information will be visible to other
users of the EPM server.  The exception is the non-domain
part of your e-mail addresses, which will NOT be visible.
<p>
After you have logged in, go to the Project Page.  When
you log in the next time, you will be automatically sent
to the Project Page.
<p>
The buttons marked ? access the Help Page, which has
detailed documentation for various pages and parts of pages.
</p>

<a name="solving-a-problem"><h1>Solving a Problem</h1></a>
<p>
To solve a problem, you first want to `pull' the problem
from a project.  Go to the Project Page and select
the problem list you want to pull the problem from.
For example, select `demos Problems'.  Then click the
`Pull' button.
<p>
Next click the oval of the problem you want to pull.
For example, click the `reverser' oval, which will turn
black.  Next click the `Submit' button.  The black oval
should turn green indicating success, and `Done!' should
appear.
<p>
Now go back to the Project page and select the `Your Problems'
problem list.  This was empty but now has `reverser' in it.
In the `Create Tab for Problem' selector, select `reverser'.
A new `reverser Problem Page' tab will be created.  You now
have two tabs, the one just created and the original
`Project Page' tab.
<p>
Go to the `reverser Problem Page' tab and click on `reverser.pdf'
to see the problem specification.
<p>
You can write your own solution, or you can click on
`Downloads' to get a window with demos problems solutions of
various kinds.  You need to get a solution on your own
computer, at which point you use `Upload a File' to
upload the solution to your reverser problem.  When it is uploaded
it is compiled, and if there are compilation errors, error
messages will be displayed and the solution will NOT
be entered into your EPM problem directory.
If there are no errors, your solution and its executable
file will be entered into your problem directory, or
`kept'.
<p>
You can see more detail about what happened during the
compilation by clicking the downward arrow buttons
on the `Commands Last Executed' and `Working Files ...'
sections.  Working files are files output by the commands
that were NOT kept, and are more likely to be of interest when
the commands fail and there are no kept files.
<p>
Each file in your problem directory has a line in the
`Current Problem Files' section of the Problem Page,
and each working file from the last executed command has
a line in the `Working Files ...' section.
After a set of commands execute, one or two files, either
kept or working,
are automatically shown, but you can show
any of your problem directory files or working files that
are ASCII text or pdf by clicking either the file name if
it is a button, or the downward arrow after the file name.
An exception is a very short one-line file whose entire contents is displayed
in { } brackets at the end of the file's Problem Page line.
<p>
Lines for files with names of the form `00-*-reverser.in'
are inputs for sample test cases.  If you click on the
`=>.score' button for such a line, the score of the
test case will be computed in the `00-*-reverser.score'
file.
<p>
In general the operations you perform consists of
making one file from another file, and typically the two
file names are identical but for their extensions.
In addition to making the .score file you can also make
a .sin solution input file, a .sout solution output file,
and a .fout filtered solution output file.  For the
`reverser' problem
the .sin file is identical to the .in file with comments
removed, and the .fout file is identical to the .sout file.
<p>
After the scores for the sample test cases are all
`Completely Correct', the problem can be submitted by
going to the `Run Page'. On this page if you click
on the `Run' button of the `sample-reverser.run' line
all the sample test cases will be run and the result
will be placed in the `sample-reverser.rout' (run output)
file.  If instead you click on the `Submit' button
on the `submit-reverser.run' line, all the test cases,
including the hidden judge' test cases with names
of the form `01-*-reverser.in', will be run and the
total result will be displayed in the `submit-reverser.rout'
file.
<p>
If there is an error in a test case during a `Submit',
the test case .in and .fout files will be linked into
your Problems Page so you can debug the test case as
you would a sample test case.
<p>
If you have downloaded a solution from the `Downloads Page',
you may wish to use it to see what happens when a solution
has errors.  If you look at a `reverser' solution, you will see that
it has a section where different types of errors
can be easily introduced either by defining a single macro
or by changing the value of a single variable.  If you use
this to introduce an error in the solution, then you can
try using the erroneous solution to produce
`.score' files on the `reverser Problem Page' or `.rout' files
on the `reverser Run Page'.
<p>
More detailed information is available in the Help Page
accessed by the `?' buttons.
</p>

<a name="creating-a-problem"><h1>Creating a Problem</h1></a>
<p>
To create a problem you start with a problem name.  Try to
choose a name that is not, and likly will not, be the name
of some project problem, as your problem name will become
embedded in all your problem file names.  We will let
PPPP stand for the problem name in what follows.
<p>
To create a problem you start with a solution, that is,
a program written in C, C++, JAVA, or PYTHON that will
solve the problem.  It is also well to start with a problem
specification written in LATEX.
<p>
You can create the problem on the Projects Page by typing
its name into the `New Problem Name' box.  This will create
a tab for the new problem.
<p>
From the new problem tab you can go to the `Downloads' Page.
There you will find sample solutions, a sample problem
specification, and a template for writing problem specifications
in LATEX.
<p>When you have written your PPPP.c, PPPP.cc, PPPP.java, or PPPP.py
solution file, upload it into
the new problem tab, and it will compile.  Debug it until
it has no compilation errors.
<p>
Similarly when you have written your PPPP.tex problem specification
file, upload it.  It will be compiled by pdflatex.  Debug it
until it has no errors.
<p>
The next step is to make a sample input file named `00-000-PPPP.in'.
Upload it, and it will be run through your solution to produce
the `00-000-PPPP.sout' solution output file.  If there are no
detected errors in this, the .in and .sout files will be kept.
<p>
Note that for the moment we are ignoring the possibility of
having special generate-PPPP and filter-PPPP programs for the
problem (see the diagram in the
<a href="#introductory-note">Introductory Note</a>).
The system will automatically
supply default versions of these which just copy their input
to their output (though the default generate-PPPP removes comments).
<p>
Read your `00-000-PPPP.sout' file and see if it is correct.  When
you think it is, on its line click `=>.fout' to make the
filtered output file `00-000-PPPP.fout', and then on the line
for that file click on `=>.ftest' to make the `00-000-PPPP.ftest'
file that is the judge's test data.  The .ftest file is
made by simply copying the .fout file.
<p>
At this point you can click the `=>.score' button on the
`00-000-PPPP.in' file and it will score your sample input.
Of course the score will necessarily be `Completely Correct',
since your .ftest file is a copy of your .fout file, and
the score is computed by comparing these two files.
<p>
So how do you know your code is correct?  Well, the best way is
to put debugging statements in your code that output extra
information.  Any output line that begins with
`!!**' is treated as a comment line and ignored, so you can
output as much debugging information as you like in these lines.
These debugging comment lines will appear in the .sout file and
.fout file and will be ignored by the epm_score program that
compares the .fout and .ftest files.
<p>
Next you should proceed to make more sample input files with
names of the form `00-001-PPPP.in', `00-002-PPPP.in', etc.
The `00-' at the beginning of the file name specifies that
it is sample input that will be give to all users who
try to solve the problem.   Names beginning `01-', `02-',
etc are judging inputs that are hidden from users who are
trying to solve the problem.
<p>
When you have all your sample inputs, make a `sample-PPPP.run'
file that just lists the names of your .in sample input files,
one name per line.  Then upload it.  Upon uploading it will be
checked to be sure that all the .in input files it names exist and
all their associated .ftest files exist.
<p>
On the `sample-PPPP.run' line there is a `Run' button.  If
you click it, the tab will switch to the Run Page and
the .run file will be run.  The results will be displayed
in a `sample-PPPP.rout' file.
<p>
Next make the judge's hidden data `01-000-PPPP.in', etc.
Often judge's data has larger test cases that must be
generated randomly.  To do this, you must write a
`generate-PPPP' program in C or C++.  There is a template
and an example on the `Downloads Page'.  If you look at
other problems that have non-default generate programs,
you can see what they do by clicking the `=>.txt' button
on their `generate-...' lines.
<p>
You may also need to make a `filter-PPPP' program, again
writing in C or C++.  There is a template and example on
the `Downloads Page', and you can see what other problems
do by clicking the `=>.txt' button on their `filter-...'
lines.
<p>
After you have finished making judge's .in and .ftest files,
make a `submit-PPPP.run' file that lists ALL the .in files,
both sample and judge's hidden.  Test this last using its
`Run' button.
<p>
Once you have debugged `submit-PPPP.run' and have a good
looking problem specification in `PPPP.pdf', you can push
the problem to a project and see if others will try to
solve it.  To see how to push the problem, go to the
Help Page, click on the Table of Contents down-arrow,
and click on Pushing Problems under Project Page.
