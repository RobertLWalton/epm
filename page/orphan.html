<h1>This Tab is Orphaned</h1>
<h2>You must close this tab!</h2>
<h3>
A tab becomes orphaned when two tabs of the same kind
(i.e., non-problem tabs, or a tabs for a specific
problem) exist simultaneously in a browser.
Then the tab create earlier becomes orphaned and can no
longer be used.
<br>
<br>
The only way for there to be two tabs of the same
kind is if you open a tab by giving it a URL and
a tab of the same kind already exists.  Then that
previously existing tab will be orphaned.
