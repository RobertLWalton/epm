<h1>This Tab is Orphaned</h1>
<h2>You must close this tab!</h2>
<h3>
You have (or have had) another tab of the same
kind (i.e., a non-problem tab, or a tab for a specific
problem) that was created after this tab, and thereby
orphaned this tab so it cannot function.
<br>
<br>
If you are running into too many orphaned
tabs, close all EPM tabs excepting a single non-orphaned
non-problem tab, if it exists.  If you close a problem
tab, it is best to be sure it is not running commands (use the Abort
check-box if necessary).  If you close all tabs
you will need to log in again.
<br>
<br>
Then once you have a single non-problem, non-orphaned tab, never close
it, and use only the Project Page in this non-problem tab
to create problem tabs.  This will usually keep tabs from
becoming orphaned.
