<h1>This Tab is Orphaned</h1>
<h2>You must close this tab!</h2>
<h3>
A tab is likely to be orphaned if you use the browser back or refresh buttons
in the tab.  You can use control-R to refresh a page.
<br>
<br>
A tab will also become orphaned if you use a copy of the URL of the
tab to open a new tab.
<br>
<br>
More specifically, a tab is orphaned if the server believes that
two tabs of the same kind have been opened.  The older tab is then
orphaned.  Unfortunately the browser back and refresh buttons
usually fool the server into believing this and cannot be reprogrammed
to do otherwise (the control-R key has been reprogrammed).
