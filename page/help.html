<a name="login-page"><h1>Login Page</h1></a>

<p>The <b>login page</b> manages login using email addresses to
identify a user and confirmation numbers to create tickets for
the user in the user's browser.  Once you have logged in, an
EPM server session is attached to your browser and your user ID
and browser ticket ID is attached to the session.
<p>
Your session is allocated:
<ul>
<li> A <a name="main-tab">main tab</a> for non-problem-specific
actions.  This is allocated on login and after login is
loaded with the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
You should NOT close this tab while you are logged in.
<li> A <a name="problem-tab">problem tab</a> for each of your
problems.
These are created using the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
There can be at most one problem tab for each of your problems.
<li> A <a name="view-window">view popup window</a> for read-only
views of files and information.
<li> A <a name="help-window">help popup window</a> for this
help page and the User Guide page.
</ul>
<p>
EPM consists of a set of pages, such as the Login Page and the
Project Page.  Each of these is assigned to a tab or window.
The Table of Contents gives the tab or window of each page in []
brackets after the entry for the page; for example, after the Login
Page one sees [main], indicating that the Login Page runs in the `main' tab.
<p>
If you close the main tab by mistake, create a new tab and load
it with the EPM server URL (that you used for logging in).
Do NOT attempt to use an analogous method to create any other
tabs or popup windows for your login session; use the buttons
that create these instead.
<p>
To change
the user ID of a session you must explicitly log out,
and then you must log back in.  Logging out should close any
problem tabs and popup windows that you have.
<p>
An account is on an <a name='EPM-server'>EPM server</a>.
EPM servers are named
by the document root URL used to access them, and EPM servers with
different names are independent of each other (even
if they are running on the same computer).
</p>

<a name="login-email"><h2>User Email Address</h2></a>
<p>
You can have up to 3 <b>email addresses</b> that map to your
user ID, and hence to your account on the EPM server.
Confirmation numbers will be sent to these email addresses
in order to create <a href="#browser-ticket">Browser Tickets</a>.
<p>
If you are making a new account, enter an appropriate
email address.  After entering the confirmation number sent
to that address, you will be routed to the
<a href="#user-page">User Page</a> to complete the process
of establishing a new account.
</p>

<a name="browser-ticket"><h2>Browser Ticket</h2></a>
<p>
A browser <b>ticket</b> is stored in the browser local memory
and enables a user to log in by giving only the email
address associated with ticket.  There is a separate
ticket for each <a href='#EPM-server'>EPM server</a>,
each browser, and
each email address of an account on the EPM server.
<p>
A ticket is created using a
<a name='confirmation-number'>confirmation number</a> sent to
the email address by the EPM server and copied from the email
into the browser by the user.  A ticket
expires after a certain interval: 2 days for the first ticket,
7 days for the second ticket, and 30 days for each
ticket thereafter.  In counting tickets, only <b>expired tickets</b>
are counted, so if you get a new ticket before the previous
one expires, the new ticket will not change your ticket expiration time.
<p>
A confirmation number is only used during ticket creation, and
cannot be used to create more than one ticket.  It is not saved
by the EPM server or browser.
<p>
During confirmation the
`<b>Get New Ticket</b>' button removes the ticket for the
entered email address and EPM server
from the browser and returns to the initial
login page.
<p>
During confirmation the
`<b>Delete All Tickets</b>' button removes the <u>all</u>
tickets for the current EPM server from the browser and returns
to the initial login page.
</p>

<a name="user-page"><h1>User Page</h1></a>

<p>
To be an EPM user you must supply the following information which
appears on the user page.

<p class='indented'>
<mark>NOTICE: All this information is PUBLIC in that it is
	       available to other users of the same EPM
	       server,
               except that current policy is that
	       the non-domain parts of email addresses
	       will be replaced by dots(...), e.g.,
	       jdoe@gurgle.com will become `...@gurgle.com'.

<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
<li><strong>User ID</strong>:<p class='list'>
A short name by which you will be known.
Must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin and end with a letter, and have at least 4 characters.
For privacy, you may wish to choose an ID that is NOT
part of your e-mail address.
<li><strong>Full Name</strong>:<p class='list'>
Your full name, so that you can be looked up on the web.
<li><strong>Organization</strong>:<p class='list'>
An organization you are associated with, so you can be
looked up in the context of this organization.
If you are not closely associated with an organization,
such as a university, you may use an organization
such as the ACM or if nothing more limited is available, Facebook.
<li><strong>Location</strong>:<p class='list'>
The location of your organization, e.g., town, state, and
country, or if the organization is nebulous, like the ACM
or Facebook, your own location.
<li><strong>Email Addresses</strong>:<p class='list'>
You must have one or more email addresses associated with
your account.  You use these to log into the account.
It is well to have two or more, in case you lose access to
one of them.
</ul>
</p>


<a name="project-page"><h1>Project Page</h1></a>
<p>
A project is a collection of problems which may be solved
by EPM users.  Before solving a problem in a project, a user pulls
the problem.  A use may also write their own new problem that does
not belong to any project, and when done, the user
may elect to push that problem to a project so other users can pull the
problem and try to solve it.
<p>
Two builtin projects are `<a name='demos'>demos</a>',
which contains demonstration
problems, and `<a name='public'>public</a>',
into which anyone may push problems
they have developed.
<p>
The project page lets you:
<ul>
<li> pull a problem you want to solve from a project
<li> create a new problem of your own that is not in a project
<li> create a problem tab for any of your own problems
     <br>
     (whether they have been pulled or created by you)
<li> push a problem you have written into a project
</ul>
<p>
To pull a problem from a project, first select the problem
list of the project, which will have a name such as
`public Problems' or `demos Problems'.  Then click the
<b>Pull</b> button, check the ovals of the problems you wish to pull,
and click
the <b>Submit</b> button.  Details are at
<a href="#project-pull">Pulling Problems</a>.
<p>
To creat a tab for one of your own problems, first
select a problem list that contains the desired problem,
such as the `Your Problems' list that contains all your
problems.  Then select the problem from the
`<b>Create Tab for Problem</b>' list.
<p>
To create a new problem of your own, simply type its name
into the `<b>Create a New Problem</b>' box.  The name
must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-) and
begin and end with a letter.  If you plan to publish
this problem in a project, you should choose a name distinct
from other problem names already in the project.
<p>
You should understand that when you create a problem of
your own, the master copies of the problem files remain on
your own computer.  These files are uploaded to the EPM
server, but the uploaded copies may not
be preserved, and cannot be downloaded.
<p>
Pushing problems is done in a manner similar to pulling
them: see <a href="#project-push">Pushing Problems</a>
for details.
<p>
When you pull or push a problem, the problem ends up in
both a directory private to you, as `Your' problem, and
in a directory within a project.  The project problem
directory is known as the <a name='parent'>parent</a>
of your problem directory.  Your problem directory will
then contain symbolic links to files in its parent.
However, solution program files are only in your problem
directory, and NOT in its parent.
<p>
You can make your own problem lists, and publish them
so others can use them.  To do this click the
`<b>Edit Lists</b>' button on the Projects Page.  See
<a href='#list-page'>List Page</a> for details.
<p>
The list of problem lists on the Projects Page is known
as the Favorites List.  This Favorites List can be edited to include or
exclude various problem lists by clicking the
`<b>Edit Favorites</b>' button on the Projects Page.
See <a href='#favorites-page'>Favorites Page</a> for
details.
<p>
You will likely not have access to all projects.  You will be
able to pull problems from `demos', but NOT push problems to it.
You will be able to both pull problems from and push problems to `public'.
Projects you have no access to will not be visible on the
Projects Page.
</p>

<a name="project-pull"><h2>Pulling Problems</h2></a>
<p>
If you want to solve a problem that someone else has written,
you must pull the problem from a project.
<p>
To pull problems, select a problems list and click `<b>Pull</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to pull.
Lastly, click <b>Submit</b>.  If all of the problems pull successfully,
the pulled problem ovals will turn green, a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can go to the Project Page or one of the
other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
Checked problems are pulled in the order they appear in the list.
If there is an error or warning pulling a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pulling.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the pull actions.
<p>
If you want to see the actions that will be taken to pull
a problem, check the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' button before
you `<b>Submit</b>'.  You will be shown the list of actions needed
to pull the problem and
asked whether or not to execute them or skip to the next
problem or cancel all pulling.  The problem's oval will become
red while you are deciding what to do about the actions.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pulled, yellow if there were errors while executing the pull
actions for the problem, and white if no pull actions were executed
for the problem.
</p>

<a name="project-push"><h2>Pushing Problems</h2></a>
<p>
If you have written your own problem, you can make it
available for others to solve by pushing the problem
into a project, such as the <a href='#public'>public</a>
project.  Then others can <a href='#project-pull'>pull</a>
your problem from the `public' project and try to solve it.
<p>
To push problems, select a problems list and click `<b>Push</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to push and
if some of these problems have not previously been pushed,
use `<b>Select Project</b>' to select the project to push
the problems into.  Lastly, click `<b>Submit</b>'.
For each problem you will be shown the list of actions needed
to push the problem and you will be given a choice as to whether
to execute these or skip the problem or cancel all pushing.
While you are deciding, the oval of the problem being processed
is red.
If you do not want to see these actions and be given this choice,
uncheck the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' oval.
<p>
If there is an error or warning pushing a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pushing.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the push actions.
<p>
When all of the problems to be pushed have been processed,
a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can go to the Project Page or one of the
other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pushed, yellow if there were errors while executing the push
actions for the problem, and white if no push actions were executed
for the problem.
</p>

<a name="problem-page"><h1>Problem Page</h1></a>

<p>
The Project Page, which runs in the <a href="#main-tab">main tab</a>,
can be used to create a <a href="#problem-tab">problem tab</a>
containing the Problem Page for each of your problems.
The Problem Page performs common operations for a problem.
At any given time a problem tab contains either the Problem Page,
or the <a href="#run-page">Run Page</a>
which executes problem submissions and sample runs, or the
<a href="#option-page">Option Page</a> which can be used to
edit execution options.
<p>
You can have several problem tabs
at one time.  However two different problem tabs must be for
different problems.
<p>
The Problem and Run Pages in a problem tab
may run background jobs that take a while to execute, and
while a background job is running for a problem, you cannot
do anything else with that problem.  But you can work on a
DIFFERENT problem, which will be in a different problem tab.
</p>

<a name="problem-names"><h2>Problem Names</h2></a>
<p>
A <a name='problem-name'><b>problem name</b></a>
can contain only letters, digits, and the
special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>).
In addition, it must begin and end with a letter.
</p>

<a name="problem-marks"><h2>Problem Marks</h2></a>
<p>
On the problem page:
<table style='margin-left:20px' class='top-align'>
<tr><td>&darr;</td><td>means `show below'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&uarr;</td><td>means `hide' (don't `show below')</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>&Chi;</pre></td><td>means `toggle overstrike of file name';
overstuck files are deleted when you `Delete Over-Struck Files'
or upload or make a new file or make a new link</td></tr>
<tr><td>&rArr;</td><td>means `make a new file with given extension from the file named at the beginning of the line'</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<a name="current-problem-files"><h2>Current Problem Files</h2></a>
<p>
The <b>current problem files</b> are the files that you have uploaded
or made for the problem, plus links to other files.
These files and links are stored in your problem
directory and can be viewed, used, or deleted.  They are displayed
in the `Current Problem File' table, one line per file or link.
<p>
Current problem <a name='file-names'><b>file names</b></a> must have particular
<a href='#file-extensions'>extensions</a> that specify their role within
the problem.  The rest of a file name can contain
only letters, digits, and the special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>), must begin with a letter or digit, and must
end with the <a href='#problem-name'>problem name</a>, which if it is
preceded by anything must be preceded by a
dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>).
<p>
Link names follow the same rules as file names, and furthermore
each link name has the same extension as the file to which it is
linked.  For example, files imported from the
<a href="#parent">parent</a> of a problem are actually links
in your problem directory to the actual file in the parent directory.
In general links are treated and talked about as if they were files.
<p>
Clicking on a file name, if it is a button,
will show the file with line numbers
in a separate window.
<p>
Clicking on &darr; will show the file below.
<p>
Files that are a single short line cannot be shown but their contents
are displayed in <pre.inline>{ }</pre> brackets at the end of the
file's line.
<p>
Empty files and binary files cannot be shown but their nature is
displayed at the end of the file's line.
<p>
Displayable files must be encoded in UTF-8 or PDF.
PDF files can only be displayed by clicking on the file name.
A UTF-8 file that is displayable has its number of lines indicated
at the end of the file's line.
Only if this number of lines is small enough does the file have
a &darr; that permits the file to be displayed below.
<p>
If a file has been pushed to or pulled from a
<a href='#project-page'>project</a>, the
file itself is not in your problem directory, but is
in the project's problem directory and is linked to your problem
directory.  These are marked by `(Linked to PROJECT)' at
the end of the file's line.  None of these files are executable.
<p>
Executable files may be links in your problem directory.
If they are links to EPM system files (such as epm_generate)
they are marked as `Link to FILE-TYPE'.  If they are links to
other files in your problem directory, they are marked as
`Link to FILE-NAME'.  This last only happens when you provide
multiple solutions to a problem: see <a href="#multiple-solutions">
Multiple Solutions</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="file-extensions"><h2>File Extensions</h2></a>
<p>
EPM files have <b>extensions</b> that indicate their format
and purpose.  In the following PPPP denotes the problem name
and XXXX denotes some other part of the name: for example,
the name XXXX-PPPP.in matches the name `00-001-reverser.in'
if XXXX is 00-001 and PPPP is `reverser'.
<p>
When a problem is pulled from a project, many of these files
of these files are supplied by the problem
<a href="#parent">parent</a>.  The pull may make links in your
problem directory to these files in the parent directory, or
the commands that make files from other files may read these
files directly from the parent directory.
<p>
The general scheme for producing a XXXX-PPPP.score file
containing a score from a XXXX-PPPP.in test case input file and
an executable solution PPPP is:
<pre style='display:block;font-size:14pt;margin-left:28px'>
generate-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sin
PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sout
filter-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin 3&lt;XXXX-PPPP.sout &gt;XXXX-PPPP.fout
epm_score XXXX-PPPP.fout XXXX-PPPP.ftest &gt;XXXX-PPPP.score
</pre>
<p>
The <b>generate-PPPP</b> program takes the .in test case
input file and produces the .sin solution input file that is
input to the solution program <b>PPPP</b> to produce
the .sout solution output file.  Then both the solution output
and solution input file are input to the <b>filter-PPPP</b>
program to produce the .fout filtered solution output.  Lastly the
<b>epm_score</b> program compares the .fout
filtered solution output to the .ftest test filtered
solution output provided by the judge to produce the .score file.
The actual commands used to execute all this are more complex
because the generate, solution, and filter programs are run in sandboxes,
as they are or may be uploaded.

<a name="problem-commands"><h2>Commands Last Executed</h2></a>
<p>
This section displays the UNIX/POSIX/LINUX commands last executed
to make a file, and if any files output by these commands are
kept in the problem directory, a list of kept files is also displayed.
<p>
Included is the CPU execution time in 0.001 second units of some of the
command lines.
<p>
If a command line fails, this is indicated along with a failure
message (but not for debugging runs that make .dout files which
contain their own failure messages, if any).
</p>

<a name="problem-working"><h2>Working Files of Last Executed Commands</h2></a>
<p>
This section lists the files made by the last executed commands
which were <u>not</u> kept.  These files can be displayed in the
same manner as the files in the
<a href="#current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</a>
section.
<p>
Files that are kept on successful uploads or makes will
remain as (usually non-empty)
working files on unsuccessful uploads or makes.
<p>
Working files are deleted when a new set of commands is executed
or when a .run file is run.
</p>

<a name="run-page"><h1>Run Page</h1></a>
<p>
If you click a <b>Run</b> button on the problem page, the associated
.run file will be run and the page will switch to the Run Page where
the results will be displayed.
<p>
A <a name='.run-file'>.run file</a> is just a list of .in files
from which .score files may be computed.  A .run file can be uploaded
on the <a href="#problem-page">Problem Page</a>,
and pushed along with other files to a project
by the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
<p>
During a run and after it is over a line is displayed for each .in
file giving its base name and the CPU execution
times of various sub-computations
needed to compute the .score file.  These times are marked
as follows:
</p>
<div class='indented'>
<table>
<tr><td>g1:</td><td>generate program making input for solution</td></tr>
<tr><td>s:</td><td>solution making .sout file from generated input</td></tr>
<tr><td>g2:</td><td>generate program making input for filter program</td></tr>
<tr><td>f:</td><td>filter program making .fout file from .sout file and generated input</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
The Run Page lists all the .run files in a table, one file per line.
For the last run of a particular .run file,
the associated run output, or .rout file is given.
If there is also a non-empty run error, or .rerr
file, it is also listed.  These files can be displayed with the &darr; button.
<p>
A .rout run output file gives the `Score' for the run, and if not
`Completely Correct', gives the name of the first failed test case.
Also given are the maximum CPU execution times over all input files
of the generate, solution, and filter programs.
<p>
If a .run file is not in your directory,
it has a `Submit' button, and submitting
it will run it (compute .score files from all the .in files) and
record the results in its .rout file that is both copied into your
problem directory and also into an administrative directory that
maintains a history of your submissions and allows every user
to see them.  This computation will not use any local files in
your problem directory except your solution binary.
<p>
If a .run file is in your directory,
it has a `Run' button, and running it will compute the .rout
file in your problem directory and NOT copy it into administrative
directories, so in this case other users cannot see the .rout file.
For problems you have pulled from a project, the sample .run file
is linked into your directory, and so can be run in this manner
without other users seeing the results.
</p>

<a name="option-page"><h1>Option Page</h1></a>

<p>The <b>Option Page</b> shows the options given to
commands that perform compilations and computations,
and allows you to edit these within limits.
<p>
For example, the allowed maximum size of the virtual memory
when a problem solution program is executing is an
option, as is the allowed maximum size of any file output
by the solution.
<p>
There are two kinds of options: <a href='#option-numbers'>numbers</a>
and <a href='#option-arguments'>arguments</a>.  Numbers are substituted
into arguments, and arguments are substituted into the commands
used to make one file from another file.
These commands are specified by templates, which  can be
displayed by clicking the `Show Templates' button to display
the <a href='#template-page'>Template Page</a> in a separate window.
<p>
There are two values for each option: an <b>inherited value</b>
and a <b>local value</b>.  The inherited value is set by
the <a href='#ancestors'><b>ancestors</b></a> of the current problem,
and cannot be changed (without changing the options files in the
ancestors).  The local value, when given, replaces the inherited value.
In displays, local values are colored green and inherited values
are colored tan.
<p>
As with other pages, clicking on a &uarr; will hide a section
of the page and clicking on a &darr; will display the section.
<p>
You can switch back and forth between just viewing options and
editing them by clicking buttons at the top of the Option Page.
When editing you can also reset all options to their inherited
values.
</p>

<a name="option-numbers"><h2>Number Options</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Number options</b> are numbers included in argument
options.  For example, the STIME option value is the maximum number of
CPU seconds allowed a problem solution program.
<p>
If you edit an inherited number option, its value will
turn green, even if you input the same value as the inherited
value.  Clicking the &#8635; symbol after the value will restore
the value to the inherited value (and restore the color to tan).
</p>

<a name="option-arguments"><h2>Argument Options</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Argument options</b> are the arguments that
are inserted into <a href='#template-page'>template commands</a>.
For each such option there
are discrete choices (for some argument options there is no
choice and the single value is `required').
<p>
<a href='#option-numbers'>Option numbers</a>
are inserted into argument options.  For example,
the STIME number option is inserted into the
`-cputime STIME' value of the SSTIME argument option.
The SSTIME argument in turn is
inserted into the template command that runs the solution program,
so that the options work together with the command to determine
the maximum number of CPU seconds
allowed the solution program.
<p>
The absence of any value for an option command argument is represented by
an empty box.
If there are two colored boxes, the
one colored green is the current value and is local, and the one
colored tan is inherited.
If only one box is colored,
the option value is inherited, even if the box is colored green
(it is green because you have clicked on the inherited value).
</p>

<a name="template-page"><h1>Template Page</h1></a>
<p>
A <b>Template</b> supplies the commands used to make one
file from another file.
Templates can be displayed in a separate
window by clicking the `Show Templates' button on
the <a href='#option-page'>Option Page</a>.
<p>
An index of all the available templates is displayed at the top
of the page.  Clicking on the box next to a template name
displays or hides the relevant contents of the template.
<p>
The commands displayed for a template are executed when the
template is used.  These contain argument names substituted 
from the <a href='#option-arguments'>argument options</a>.
Each substitutable argument name is preceeded in its command by a dollar
sign ($).
In addition to argument option substitutions, the problem
name is substituted for PPPP, and the reminder of the file names
is substituted for other sequences of 4 consecutive capital
letters, such as XXXX or YYYY.
<p>
The template selected for a particular
task is controlled by the extensions of the input and output
files, but also by what other files are available.  For example,
several tempates are available to make a .score file with
a score from an .in file with solution input.  One of these
is selected if there is a binary file with no extension
(for C or C++);
another is selected if there is a binary file with the .class
extension (for JAVA); and a third is selected if there is a binary
file with the .py extension (for PYTHON).
Files which are required to use a
template are call the <b>required files</b> of the template.
<p>
Some required files may be <b>creatable</b>.  There are automatically
created from defaults if they do not exist.  For example, the
generate_PPPP program will be created from a default that does
nothing but strip comments from a .in file to make a .sin file.
<p>
Some required files are required to be <b>local</b>, that is, not
in an ancestor of the current problem.  Others are required to be
<b>remote</b>, that is, they <u>must</u> be in an ancestor of the
current problem (i.e., in a project).
Lastly many required files can be either local or
remote.  When a creatable file is created, it is always created
locally, so it must not be a remote required file.
<p>
In addition the template selected is controlled by <b>conditions</b>.
For example, to be used during the upload of a PPPP.cc file, a
template must have the `UPLOAD PPPP.cc' condition.
As another example, a template used when a .run file is submitted
must have the `SUBMIT' condition.
Most of the time only templates with no conditions are selected.
</p>

<a name="list-page"><h1>List Page</h1></a>
<p>
You can create a problem list of your own by typing its name into
the `New Problem List Name' box in either the Project Page or its
`Edit List' subpage, or by uploading a list description on
the project page
(see <a href=#list-descriptions>List Descriptions</a>).
<p>
When it is created the list is added to the beginning of the
Favorites list
(see <a href=#favorites-page>Favorites Page</a>).
and can be edited by clicking `Edit List'.  However, before you
edit your new list, edit a list from which you are going to copy
problems
TBD

</p>

<a name="list-descriptions"><h2>List Descriptions</h2></a>
<p>
</p>

<a name="favorites-page"><h1>Favorites Page</h1></a>
<p>
The `Favorites' list is a list of those problem lists
you find most interesting, in order of interest.
This Favorites Page is a sub-page of the Project Page
that allows you to edit the Favorites list.
<p>
This Favorites Page displays all the lists that can be on the
Favorites list, each with an oval that is checked
for those problem lists that are on the Favorites list.
The checked lists are in the order that they appear in
the Favorites list.  Lists created by users may also have an
attached description created by their author.
<p>
If you click on a oval it toggles between checked and
unchecked.  In either case
its list is moved to the boundary between checked and unchecked
lists, so the checked lists are always above the unchecked
lists.
<p>
You can change the order of lists by dragging a list
to a second list below which you want the first list to be.
To move a list to the top, drag it to the `Favorites' title
line.
<p>
Changes you make are not recorded until you click `Update'
or `Finish'.  Clicking `Reset' or `Cancel' restores Favorites
to its previous state.  `Finish' and `Cancel' return to the Projects Page.
