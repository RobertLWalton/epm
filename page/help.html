<a name="login-page"><h1>Login Page</h1>

<p>The <b>login page</b> manages login using email addresses to
identify a user and confirmation numbers to create tickets for
the user in the browser.

<a name="login-email"><h2>User Email Address</h2>
<p>
Your <b>email address</b> serves as your account name,
and also as the place to which confirmation numbers
will be sent.
<p>
If you are making a new account, enter an appropriate
email address.
<p>
You can have up to 3 email addresses associated with
your account.  Its a good idea to have at least 2,
in case one is not working when you need it.

<a name="login-ticket"><h2>Browser Ticket</h2>
<p>
A browser <b>ticket</b> is stored in the browser local memory
and enables a user to log in by giving only the email
address associated with ticket.  There is a separate
ticket for each email address and each browser.
<p>
A ticket is created using a <b>confirmation number</b> sent to
the email address and entered into the browser.  A ticket
expires after a certain interval: 2 days for the first ticket,
7 days for the second ticket, and 30 days for each
ticket thereafter (a new ticket obtained before the previous
ticket expires is not counted as a new ticket for these
purposes).

<a name="problem-page"><h1>Problem Page</h1>

<p>
At any given time you have a <b>current problem</b> you are working on.
The <b>problem page</b> allows you to create problems, select an
existing problem, and manage the current problem.
<p>
On the problem page:
<table style='margin-left:20px'>
<tr><td>&darr;</td><td>means `show below'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&uarr;</td><td>means `hide'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&Chi;</td><td>means `mark for deletion';
deletion does not occur until you `Delete Marked Files'
or make a new file</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>means `remove deletion mark'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&rArr;</td><td>means `make a new file with given extension from the file named on the same line'</td></tr>
</table>


<a name="problem-names"><h2>Problem Names</h2>
<p>
A <b>problem name</b> can contain only letters, digits, and the
special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>).
In addition, it must begin with a letter.

<a name="current-problem-files"><h2>Current Problem Files</h2>
<p>
The <b>current problem files</b> are the files that you have uploaded
or created for the problem.  These files are stored in the problem
directory and can be viewed, used, or deleted.  They are displayed
in the `Current Problem File' table, one line per file.
<p>
Clicking on a file name will show the file with line numbers
to the right, unless
the page is too narrow in which case it will show the file below.
<p>
Clicking on &darr; will show the file below.
<p>
Files that are a single short line cannot be shown but their contents
are displayed in <pre.inline>{ }</pre> brackets at the end of the
file's line.
<p>
Empty files and binary files cannot be shown but their nature is
displayed at the end of the file's line.
<p>
Displayable files are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8 or PDF.
A UTF-8 file that is displayable has its number of lines indicated
at the end of the file's line.
