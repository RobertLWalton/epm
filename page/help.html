<h1 id="introductory-note">Introductory Note</h1>
<p>
EPM (the Educational Problem Manager) is intended to
make it easier for one user to develop a programming problem and
then make it available for other users to solve.
Problem development is mostly a matter of creating
test case input and output in a form suitable for automatic
scoring, and then debugging the problem solution and specification
against the test cases.
<p>
The following diagram specifies the data flow used to score
a test case for a problem named PPPP.  For simple problems,
generate-PPPP simply copies its input to its output removing
comments, and filter-PPPP simply copies its input to its
output (epm_score ignores comments).  In more complex cases
generate-PPPP uses commands from the .in file to generate
.sin solution input using a pseudo-random number generator,
and filter-PPPP analyzes the .sin and .sout files to produce
a summary used in scoring (e.g., it might read a graph from .sin
and check that a path in .sout is in fact a path in the graph,
outputting the path length if it is and an error message otherwise).

<h1 id="login-page">Login Page</h1>

<p>
To log into an EPM account,
you open the URL of the EPM server you wish to access
and load its <b>Login Page</b>.  This page accepts a
    <b id='login-name'>login name</b> of the one of the forms:
<br>
<table class='login-name'>
<tr><td>User-E-Mail-Address</td><td>User Account</td></tr>
<tr><td>Team-ID:Member-E-Mail-Address</td>
    <td>Team Member in Team Account</td></tr>
<tr><td>User-ID:Guest-E-Mail-Address</td>
    <td>Guest in User Account</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
EPM has two kinds of accounts: user accounts and team accounts.
These behave similarly in most circumstances.
Both kinds of accounts are named by an
<b id='account-ID'>account ID</b>, which is
either a <b id='user-ID'>user ID</b> or a <b id='team-ID'>team ID</b>.
E-mail addresses map to user IDs, and a single user can have several
e-mail addresses.  Teams have members, which
are user accounts.  A user may have guests, which are other users
who are allowed to see the user's account but not change it.
<a href="#guests">Guests</a> and <a href='#teams'>teams</a>
are discussed separately.
<p>
An account is on an <b id='EPM-server'>EPM server</b>.
EPM servers are named
by the document root URL used to access them, and EPM servers with
different names are independent of each other (even
if they are running on the same computer).
<p>
Once you have logged in, an
EPM server <b id='session'>session</b>
for your login name is attached to your browser,
and a ticket for future use with the login name is stored in your browser
local memory.  The ticket enables you to log in again using the
same login name and browser without having to receive a confirmation
number by e-mail.
<p>
Your session is allocated:
<ul>
<li> A <b id="main-tab">main tab</b> for non-problem-specific
actions.  This is allocated on login and after login is
loaded with the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
You should not close this tab while you are logged in, but if
you do you can recover it by re-using the EPM server URL you
originally used to open this tab.
<li> A <b id="problem-tab">problem tab</b> for each of your
problems.
These are created using the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
There can be at most one problem tab for each of your problems.
<li> An <b id="aux-window">auxiliary window</b> for read-only
views of files and information.  Views of
read-only information are placed by default in this
window, but
if you hold down an ALT key while launching a view that would
normally go in the auxiliary window,
a separate floating window will be created instead that is
dedicated to the content of the particular view (e.g., this allows
each file being viewed to have its own window).
<li> A <b id="help-window">help window</b> for this
Help Page and the User Guide page.
<li> A <b id="documents-index-window">documents index window</b> holding
an index of available documents, and a
<b id="downloads-index-window">downloads index window</b> holding
an index of downloadable example files.
</ul>
<p>
EPM consists of a set of pages, such as the Login Page and the
Project Page.  Each of these is assigned to a tab or window.
The Table of Contents gives the tab or window of each page in []
brackets after the entry for the page; for example, after the Login
Page one sees [main], indicating that the Login Page runs in the `main' tab.
<p>
If you close the main tab by mistake, create a new tab and load
it with the EPM server URL (that you used for logging in).
Do NOT attempt to use an analogous method to create any other
tabs or popup windows for your login session; use the buttons
that create these instead.
<p>
<b>DO NOT USE</b> the browser Back or Forward buttons, as these
will invalidate your tab.  You may use the refresh keys, or the
&#8635; refresh button next to the ? help button.  Many pages
can be put into an editing mode in which the &#8635; button disappears
and the refresh keys are disabled.
<p>
To change the account ID of
a session you must explicitly log out,
and then you must log back in.  You can log out using
the `Logout' button on the <a href='#user-page'>User Page</a>
which should close any
problem tabs and popup windows that you have.
Or you can simply close and reopen your browser.
</p>

<h2 id="login-e-mail">User E-Mail Address</h2>
<p>
You can have up to 3 <b>e-mail addresses</b> that map to your
user ID, and hence to your account on the EPM server.
Confirmation numbers will be sent to these e-mail addresses
in order to create <a href="#browser-ticket">Browser Tickets</a>.
<p>
If you are making a new account, enter an appropriate
e-mail address.  After entering the confirmation number sent
to that address, you will be routed to the
<a href="#user-page">User Page</a> to complete the process
of establishing a new account.
</p>

<h2 id="browser-ticket">Browser Ticket</h2>
<p>
A browser <b>ticket</b> is stored in the browser local memory
and enables an account to log in by giving only the login name
associated with ticket.  There is a separate
ticket for each <a href='#EPM-server'>EPM server</a>,
each browser, and each login name.
<p>
When you first use a login name with your browser, your browser
has no ticket.  Therefore
the server e-mails you a ticket called a <b>confirmation number</b>,
which you enter into the browser.  The browser sends this
to the server, which logs the browser in.
<p>
Every time the browser sends a ticket to the server, if
the server accepts the ticket and logs the browser in,
then the server sends the browser a replacement ticket.  A
ticket can be used only once.  Should the server reject a ticket,
it will give you another confirmation number.
<p>
When you first log using a given e-mail address,
your first <b>auto-login period</b> for that e-mail address begins.
During this period the server accepts tickets associated
with the e-mail address from browsers that have them.
At the end of this period the server e-mails you a confirmation
number when you next log in using the e-mail address, and
starts a new auto-login period when it receives the confirmation
number.  The first auto-login period is 2 days, the second
is 7 days, and all the rest are 30 days.
</p>

<h1 id="user-page">User Page</h1>

<p>
To be an EPM user you must supply the following information which
appears on the User Page.

<p class='indented'>
<mark>NOTICE: All this information is PUBLIC in that it is
	       available to other users of the same EPM
	       server,
               except that current policy is that
	       the non-domain parts of e-mail addresses
	       will be replaced by dots(...), e.g.,
	       jdoe@gurgle.com will become `...@gurgle.com'.

<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
<li><strong>User ID</strong>:<p class='list'>
A short name by which you will be known.
Must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin a letter, end with a letter or digit, and have at least 4 characters.
For privacy, you may wish to choose an ID that is NOT
part of your e-mail address.
<mark>NOTICE: Once you have created your account, you
CANNOT CHANGE your user ID!</mark>
<li><strong>Full Name</strong>:<p class='list'>
Your full name, so that you can be looked up on the web.
<li><strong>Organization</strong>:<p class='list'>
An organization you are associated with, so you can be
looked up in the context of this organization.
If you are not closely associated with an organization,
such as a university, you may use an organization
such as the ACM or if nothing more limited is available, Facebook.
<li><strong>Location</strong>:<p class='list'>
The location of your organization, e.g., town, state, and
country, or if the organization is nebulous, like the ACM
or Facebook, your own location.
<li><strong>E-Mail Addresses</strong>:<p class='list'>
You must have one or more e-mail addresses associated with
your account.  You use these to log into the account.
It is well to have two or more, in case you lose access to
one of them.
<li><strong>Guests</strong>:<p class='list'>
You may have <a href='#guests'>guests</a>
which are other user accounts that
can see but not change the contents of your account.
A guest account is specified by giving the user ID of the account.
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="guests">Guests</h2>
<p>
If you are a guest of another user, you may log in as a guest
using a login name of the form:
<div style='text-align:center;padding:4px'>
Host-ID:E-Mail-Address
</div>
<p>
where Host-ID is the user ID of the user whose guest you are
(your `host') and E-Mail-Address is one of the e-mail addresses
associated with your own account.
<p>
Your guest login session is logged into the host account,
but will only be able to see the contents of the host account,
and will not be able to change these contents.
<p>
When you are logged in as a guest, you cannot edit
your own profile or the profile of teams of which you are
a manager, and you cannot create new teams.
</p>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>
A team account is like a user account except that:
<ol>
<li>A team account has <strong>members</strong> instead of e-mail addresses.
    Members are user accounts named by user IDs or by e-mail
    addresses that map to user IDs.
<li>All the members of a team account can log into the
    account at one time.  But only one of these login sessions can be
    read-write; the rest must be read-only.
<li>When you log into a team account, you give a
    login name of the form:
    <div style='text-align:center;padding:4px'>
    Team-ID:E-Mail-Address
    </div>
    instead of just an e-mail address.  The Team-ID in
    this login name is the account ID of the login session;
    the e-mail-address identifies you and specifies the
    user ID associated with the login session.
<li>A team also has a <b>manager</b>, which is the account
    that can edit the profile of the team and add or delete
    team members.
</ol>
<p>
Because a team account session is like a user account session
in most ways, in most contexts EPM documentation uses
the term `<b>user</b>' to mean
either a user account or a team account.
<p>
When you are logged in as a team member there is a button
in the upper right corner of all <a href='#main-tab'>main tab</a>
pages, next to the help button,
that you can use to switch your login session
from read-only to read-write and back.
This button is labeled `<b>RW</b>' to switch from read-only to
read-write, or `<b>RO</b>' to switch from read-write to read-only.
<p>
At most one login session at a time for the team account can be read-write.
A read-write session must be switched, by using the RO button,
to read-only, so that all account sessions are read-only, before
an session can be switched using the RW button to read-write.
All the people logged into the same team account at one time
should have open-mike audio communications, or a text-based equivalent,
to make this work.
<p>
However there is an exception to this last paragraph to handle
the case where a team member has forgetfully left their login session in
read-write mode.  The <b>User Page</b> RW button is special, in that
it will allow you to force the switch from read-only to read-write
even if another user is read-write, by forcing that other user
into read-only mode.
<p>
Any user can make a team using the User Page.  A team has a profile
like a user profile, except that a team also has a
<b id='manager'>manager</b>, that is the user account that can
edit the profile and add or delete team members.  New team
members can be identified by either their user ID or by one
of their e-mail addresses.  A manager can change a team's
manager to another manager.
<p>
It is possible to identify a new team member using an e-mail
address that is not yet associated with a user account,
and the associated user ID will be determined automatically
when the e-mail address is associate with a user account.
This allows team members to be added to the team before
they have established user accounts on the EPM server.
<p>
When you are logged in as a team member, you cannot edit
your own profile or the profile of teams of which you are
a manager, and you cannot create new teams, even if you
are in read-write mode.
</p>


<h1 id="project-page">Project Page</h1>
<p>
A project is a collection of problems which may be solved
by EPM users.  Before solving a problem in a project, a user pulls
the problem from the project.
A user may also write their own new problem that does
not belong to any project, and when done, the user
may elect to push that problem to a project so other users can pull the
problem from the project and try to solve it.
<p>
Two builtin projects are `<b id='demos'>demos</b>',
which contains demonstration
problems, and `<b id='public'>public</b>',
into which anyone may push problems
they have developed.
<p>
The Project Page lets you:
<ul>
<li> view descriptions of problem lists
<li> display or download descriptions problems in a problem list
<li> pull a problem you want to solve from a project
<li> create a new problem of your own that is not in a project
<li> create a problem tab for any of your own problems
     <br>
     (whether they have been pulled or created by you)
<li> push a problem you have written into a project
</ul>
<p>
The description of the current problem list is displayed if it
exists.
To display the description of a problem in the current problem
list, click on on the problem
name at the bottom of the page.  To download the description,
click on the problem name while holding the control key down.
<p>
To pull a problem from a project, first select the problem
list of the project, which will have a name such as
`public Problems' or `demos Problems'.  Then click the
<b>Pull</b> button, check the ovals of the problems you wish to pull,
and click
the <b>Submit</b> button.  Details are at
<a href="#project-pull">Pulling Problems From Project</a>.
<p>
To create a tab for one of your own problems, first
select a problem list that contains the desired problem,
such as the `Your Problems' list that contains all your
problems.  Then select the problem from the
`<b>Create Tab for</b>' problem list.
<mark>`Create Tab for' only exists of the current
problem list contains some problems that you
previously created or pulled.</mark>
<p>
To create a new problem of your own, simply type its name
into the `<b>Create New Problem</b>' box.  The name
must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin with a letter, and end with a letter or digit.  If you plan to publish
this problem in a project, you should choose a name distinct
from other problem names already in the project.
<p>
You should understand that when you create a problem of
your own, the master copies of the problem files remain on
your own computer.  These files are uploaded to the EPM
server, but the uploaded copies might not
be preserved.
<p>
Pushing problems is done in a manner similar to pulling
them: see <a href="#project-push">Pushing Problems to Project</a>
for details.
<p>
When you pull or push a problem, the problem ends up in
both a directory private to you, as `Your' problem, and
in a directory within a project.  The project problem
directory is known as the <b id='parent'>parent</b>
of your problem directory.  Your problem directory will
then contain symbolic links to files in its parent.
However, solution program files are only in your problem
directory, and NOT in its parent.
<p>
You can make your own problem lists, and publish them
so others can use them.  To do this click the
`<b>Edit Lists</b>' button on the Projects Page.  See
<a href='#list-page'>List Page</a> for details.
<p>
The list of problem lists on the Projects Page is known
as the Favorites List.  This Favorites List can be edited to include or
exclude various problem lists by clicking the
`<b>Edit Favorites</b>' button on the Projects Page.
See <a href='#favorites-page'>Favorites Page</a> for
details.
<p>
You will likely not have access to all projects.  You will be
able to pull problems from `demos', but NOT push problems to it.
You will be able to both pull problems from and push problems to `public'.
Projects you have no access to will not be visible on the
Projects Page.  See <a href='#manage-page'>Manage Page</a> for
details.
</p>

<h2 id="project-pull">Pulling Problems From Project</h2>
<p>
If you want to solve a problem that someone else has written,
you must pull the problem from a project.  Pulling a problem
creates a local directory for the problem, that is, your own
private local directory for the problem, and then creates links
in this directory to files in the project problem directory.
Only some files are linked in this manner.  You have to upload
a executable solution to your local directory to do things
like making score files.
<p>
Note that if you wrote and pushed the problem, so the project
problem is yours and not someone else's, all the project problem
files will be linked into your local directory, rather than
just those you should have to try to solve the problem.
<p>
To pull problems, in the Project Page
select a problems list and click `<b>Pull</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to pull.
Lastly, click <b>Submit</b>.  If all of the problems pull successfully,
the pulled problem ovals will turn green, a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can click `<b>Finish</b>' or
go to one of the other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
Checked problems are pulled in the order they appear in the list.
If there is an error or warning pulling a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pulling.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the pull actions.
<p>
If you want to see the actions that will be taken to pull
a problem, check the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' button before
you `<b>Submit</b>'.  You will be shown the list of actions needed
to pull the problem and
asked whether or not to execute them or skip to the next
problem or cancel all pulling.  The problem's oval will become
red while you are deciding what to do about the actions.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pulled,
yellow if the problem was skipped because errors were detected
in compiling the problem's pull actions (no actions were actually
performed),
and white if the problem was skipped over.
</p>

<h2 id="project-push">Pushing Problems to Project</h2>
<p>
If you have written your own problem, you can make it
available for others to solve by pushing the problem
into a project, such as the <a href='#public'>public</a>
project.  Then others can <a href='#project-pull'>pull</a>
your problem from the `public' project and try to solve it.
<p>
To push a problem to a project you must have `push-new' privilege
for the project.  You may re-push a problem you have previously
pushed in order to update it.  To re-push you must have `re-push'
privilege for the project problem.  When you initially push a problem,
and thereby create the project problem, you are given `owner'
and `re-push' privileges for the project problem.
See <a href='#manage-page'>Manage Page</a> for details.
<p>
When you push a problem, files in your local problem directory
are moved to its parent project problem directory and links are
made in your local problem directory to these moved files.
One consequence of this is that all runs you do for the problem
will be local, and you will not be able to submit the problem.
However your local runs give results identical to submissions
(they just are not recorded as submissions), as long
as you have not replaced any local links by updated files.
If you do replace local links by updated files, you may want
to re-push after you have finished testing the updates.
<p>
If you delete a file link in your local problem directory
whose target is a file the parent directory, executions are likely to still
work as in most cases a file will be taken from either the
local directory or the parent, with the local directory
preferred for non-submissions, and the parent version required
for non-solution-executables for submissions.
If you delete a local problem directory link of a .run file,
you will find that you can now submit the file.  If you
want to restore local links you have deleted, you may do
so by pulling the problem.
<p>
To push problems, in the Project Page select a problems list
and click `<b>Push</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to push and
if some of these problems have not previously been pushed,
use `<b>Select Project</b>' to select the project to push
the problems into.  Lastly, click `<b>Submit</b>'.
For each problem you will be shown the list of actions needed
to push the problem and you will be given a choice as to whether
to execute these or skip the problem or cancel all pushing.
While you are deciding, the oval of the problem being processed
is red.
If you do not want to see these actions and be given this choice,
uncheck the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' oval.
<p>
If there is an error or warning pushing a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pushing.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the push actions.
<p>
When all of the problems to be pushed have been processed,
a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can click `<b>Finish</b>' or
go to one of the
other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pushed,
yellow if the problem was skipped because errors were detected
in compiling the problem's push actions (no actions were actually
performed),
and white if the problem was skipped over.
</p>

<h1 id="problem-page">Problem Page</h1>

<p>
The <a href='#project-page'>Project Page</a>,
which runs in the <a href="#main-tab">main tab</a>,
can be used to create a <a href="#problem-tab">problem tab</a>
containing the Problem Page for any one of your problems.
The Problem Page performs common operations for a problem.
At any given time a problem tab contains either the Problem Page,
or the <a href="#run-page">Run Page</a>
which executes problem submissions and sample runs, or the
<a href="#option-page">Option Page</a> which can be used to
edit execution options.
<p>
You can have several problem tabs
at one time.  However two different problem tabs must be for
different problems.
<p>
The Problem and Run Pages in a problem tab
may run background jobs that take a while to execute, and
while a background job is running for a problem, you cannot
do anything else with that problem, except click the
`<b>ABORT</b>' button to abort the background job.
But you can work on a
DIFFERENT problem, which will be in a different problem tab.
</p>

<h2 id="problem-names">Problem Names</h2>
<p>
A <b id='problem-name'>problem name</b>
can contain only letters, digits, and the
special character
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>).
In addition, it must begin with a letter and end with a letter or digit.
Unlike other EPM names, a problem name can NOT contain a
dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>), as problem names must also be JAVA class
names.
</p>

<h2 id="problem-marks">Problem Marks</h2>
<p>
On the Problem Page:
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>&darr;</td><td>means `show below'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&uarr;</td><td>means `hide' (don't `show below')</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>&Chi;</pre></td><td>means `toggle overstrike of file name';
overstuck files are deleted when you `Delete Over-Struck Files'
or upload or make a new file or make a new link</td></tr>
<tr><td>&rArr;</td><td>means `make a new file with given extension from the file named at the beginning of the line'</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<h2 id="current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</h2>
<p>
The <b>current problem files</b> are the files that you have uploaded
or made for the problem, plus links to other files.
These files and links are stored in your problem
directory and can be viewed, used, or deleted.  They are displayed
in the `Current Problem File' table, one line per file or link.
<p>
The order in which the file lines appear can be changed.  The
default is `<b>extension order</b>' which sorts on file extension
first and file basename second.  You can also have the file lines
sorted in `<b>most recent first</b>' or `<b>alphabetic order</b>'
(i.e., basename first, extension second).
<p>
Current problem <b id='file-names'>file names</b> must have particular
<a href='#file-extensions'>extensions</a> that specify their role within
the problem.  The rest of a file name can contain
only letters, digits, and the special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>), must begin with a letter or digit, and must
end with the <a href='#problem-name'>problem name</a>, which if it is
preceded by anything must be preceded by a
dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>).
<p>
Link names follow the same rules as file names, and furthermore
each link name has the same extension as the file to which it is
linked.  For example, files imported from the
<a href="#parent">parent</a> of a problem are actually links
in your problem directory to the actual file in the parent directory.
Usually links are treated and talked about as if they were files.
<p>
Clicking on a file name, if it is a button,
will show the file with line numbers
in a separate <a href='#aux-window'>auxiliary window</a>.
There is an exception for PDF files,
which will be rendered as a document in the separate auxiliary window.
<p>
Files that are a single short line cannot be shown but their contents
are displayed in <pre.inline>{ }</pre> brackets at the end of the
file's line.
<p>
Empty files and binary files cannot be shown but their nature is
displayed at the end of the file's line.
<p>
Displayable files must be encoded in UTF-8 or PDF.
A UTF-8 file that is displayable has its number of lines indicated
at the end of the file's line.
<p>
If a file has been pushed to or pulled from a
<a href='#project-page'>project</a>, the
file itself is not in your problem directory, but is
in the project's problem directory and is linked to your problem
directory.  These are marked by `(Link to PROJECT-NAME project)' at
the end of the file's line.
Files that are links to default EPM system files
(such as epm_default_generate)
are marked as `(Link to default)'.  Files that are links to
other files in your problem directory are marked as
`(Link to FILE-NAME)'.  This last only happens when you provide
multiple solutions to a problem: see <a href="#multiple-solutions">
Multiple Solutions</a> for details.
<p>
You can download a file by clicking on its name while holding
a control key down, provided the file name is in a button or
is in a box with a black boundary line.
</p>

<h2 id="file-extensions">File Extensions</h2>
<p>
EPM files have <b>extensions</b> that indicate their format
and purpose.  In the following PPPP denotes the problem name
and XXXX denotes some other part of the name: for example,
the name XXXX-PPPP.in matches the name `00-001-reverser.in'
if XXXX is 00-001 and PPPP is `reverser'.
<p>
When a problem is pulled from a project, many of these files
are supplied by the problem
<a href="#parent">parent</a>.  The pull may make links in your
problem directory to these files in the parent directory, or
the commands that make files from other files may read these
files directly from the parent directory.
<p>
The general scheme for producing a XXXX-PPPP.score file
containing a score from a XXXX-PPPP.in test case input file and
an executable solution PPPP is:
<pre class='code'>
generate-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sin
PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sout
filter-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin 3&lt;XXXX-PPPP.sout &gt;XXXX-PPPP.fout
epm_score XXXX-PPPP.fout XXXX-PPPP.ftest &gt;XXXX-PPPP.score
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="#generate-and-filter">generate-PPPP</a>
program takes the .in test case
input file and produces the .sin solution input file that is
input to the solution program <b>PPPP</b> to produce
the .sout solution output file.  Then both the solution output
and solution input file are input to the
<a href="#generate-and-filter">filter-PPPP</a>
program to produce the .fout filtered solution output.  Lastly the
<b>epm_score</b> program compares the .fout
filtered solution output to the .ftest test filtered
solution output provided by the judge to produce the .score file.
The actual commands used to execute all this are more complex
because the generate, solution, and filter programs are run in sandboxes,
as they may be uploaded.  The solution program is of course
provided by the problem solver, but the generate and filter
programs are provided by the problem setter (the person who
creates the problem).
</p>

<h2 id="problem-solution-files">Problem Solution Files</h2>

<p>
The following files are relevant to solving the problem named
PPPP.  Some files are supplied by the <a href="#parent">parent</a> from which
the problem was pulled.
<p>
When a file is uploaded, another file is made,
but if this second file cannot be made successfully, the file to be
uploaded is not uploaded.  In this case information concerning the
error will be available in the Working Files.

</p>

<h2 id="generate-and-filter">Generate and Filter Programs</h2>
<p>
The generate, filter, monitor, and scoring programs all follow
the conventions that a line beginning `!!' is special, that
input (.in) file lines beginning with `!!##' are comment lines
and are removed (by the generate program) so the solution never sees them,
and that solution output (.sout) file lines beginning with `!!**' are
comment lines that may be used for debugging output (and are
ignored by the scoring program).
<p>
Other lines beginning with `!!' should only be used in .in input
files with generate programs that understand how to interpret them.
<p>
The default generate program simply copies its input to its output
removing lines beginning `!!##', which are considered comment lines.
If you are writing your own problem, you may write a generate
program (e.g., generate-PPPP.cc) that treats lines beginning with
`!!<some-leter>' as instructions to generate a sequence of
input lines, typically using a pseudo-random number generated
built into the generate program (so it will not change when
standard libraries are updated)
and seeded by a number in the input instruction line.
<p>
For example, `!!L seed m n' could generate a line containing
m numbers randomly chosen in the range [1,n] with seed being
the pseudo-random number generator seed.  Here `L' is the literal
letter L, and seed, m, and n are natural number parameters.
See the Downloads Page (accessible from any Problem Page)
for source code of an example generate program.
<p>
The default filter program simply copies solution output
(which it gets from file descriptor 3) to its standard output.
The solution output can contain comments beginning `!!**'.
If you are writing your own problem, you may write a filter
program (e.g., filter-PPPP.cc) that computes data from the
solution input (output of the generate program) and the
solution output and replaces part of the solution output
with lines it produces.
<p>
For example, if the solution is supposed to produce a shortest path
in a graph, then the filter might check that the answer
is in fact a graph path, and replace the answer by the length
of the path.  The filter reads the solution input from its
standard input, file descriptor 0, to construct the graph, and
reads the solution output from file descriptor 3.
See the Downloads Page (accessible from any Problem Page)
for source code of an example filter program.
<p>
The epm_score scoring program treats any line beginning with
`!!' as a comment line, which it ignores.  If the default
generate program sees a line beginning with `!!' but NOT
`!!##', it treats it as a comment line and removes it,
but also issues a warning message on to its standard error
file.  Similarly if the default filter program sees a
solution output line beginning with `!!' but NOT `!!**',
it outputs the line but issues a warning message.
</p>

<h2 id="display">The Display Program</h2>
<p>
The display-PPPP program reads an XXXX-PPPP.sin file and its
corresponding XXXX-PPPP.sout file and produces an
XXXX-PPPP.disp file that can be input to the epm_display
program to produce a XXXX-PPPP.pdf file containing a
geometric display.  The scheme for doing this is:
<pre class='code'>
generate-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sin
PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sout
display-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin 3&lt;XXXX-PPPP.sout &gt;XXXX-PPPP.disp
epm_display &lt;XXXX-PPPP.disp &gt;XXXX-PPPP.pdf
</pre>
<p>
Note the display-PPPP gets its .sin file from file descriptor
1 and its .sout file from file descriptor 3.  The input/output
structure of display-PPPP is the same as that of a filter-PPPP
program, so if you are writing display-PPPP.cc you may find
the filter template epm_filter.cc useful.
<p>
There are no general standards for formatting the input to display-PPPP;
the input formats are completely problem-specific.
</p>

<h2 id="multiple-solutions">Multiple Solutions</h2>
<p>
If you are writing in the C language, so that normally you
would provide a solution PPPP.c, you may provide multiple
solutions named YYYY-PPPP.c, for various YYYY.  Then
after upload you will have files YYYY-PPPP and YYYY-PPPP.c
with `Link' buttons after them.  Clicking a `Link' button
for YYYY-PPPP will create a link PPPP&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;YYYY-PPPP,
and similarly the `Link' button for
for YYYY-PPPP.c will create a link PPPP.c&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;YYYY-PPPP.c.
This last is only useful if you are making something that
requires the source file, such as a .dout debugging file.
<p>
Other source languages behave similarly.
<p>
When a link is being created to an executable solution file, all
executable solution files are first deleted automatically.
This is a convenience feature, as if you have several executable
solutions for different programming languages, you cannot
make .score files and other files made with solution executables.
However this does not apply to solution source files: e.g.,
you can have PPPP.c and PPPP.java at the same time.
<p>
When choosing names YYYY-PPPP.c for your solutions, you must
avoid having YYYY be any of `generate', `filter', or `monitor'
or end in `-generate', `-filter', or `-monitor',
as such files are treated not as solutions but as generate,
filter, or monitor programs.
</p>

<h2 id="problem-commands">Commands Last Executed</h2>
<p>
This section displays the UNIX/POSIX/LINUX commands last executed
to make a file, and if any files output by these commands are
kept in the problem directory, a list of kept files is also displayed.
<p>
Included is the CPU execution time in 0.001 second units of some of the
command lines.
<p>
If a command line fails, this is indicated along with a failure
message (but not for debugging runs that make .dout files which
contain their own failure messages, if any).
The indications take the form of footnotes marked by
<span class='notemark'>*</span>,
<span class='notemark'>**</span>,
<span class='notemark'>***</span>, etc.
<p>
The lines of kept files in the
<a href="#current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</a>
section
are also highlighted by using a darker background color.  Some
of these files, particularly PDF files, are automatically shown
in a separate <a href='#aux-window'>auxiliary window</a>.
<p>
The `<b>Delete Working Files and Command History</b>' button
deletes this section and stops any kept files from being
highlighted or automatically shown.
</p>

<h2 id="problem-working">Working Files of Last Executed Commands</h2>
<p>
This section lists the files made by the last executed commands
which were <u>not</u> kept.  These files can be displayed in the
same manner as the files in the
<a href="#current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</a>
section.
<p>
Working files that should be examined after an unsuccessful run
are highlighted in yellow.  Some of these files may be automatically
displayed.
<p>
Files that are kept on successful uploads or makes will
remain as (usually non-empty)
working files on unsuccessful uploads or makes.
<p>
Working files are deleted when a new set of commands is executed,
when a .run file is run, or when the
`<b>Delete Working Files and Command History</b>' button is clicked.
</p>

<h1 id="run-page">Run Page</h1>
<p>
If you click a <b>Run</b> button on the Problem Page, the associated
.run file will be run and the page will switch to the Run Page where
the results will be displayed.
<p> The Run Page displays both .run files that are listed on
the Problem Page, and may be `Run', and .run files that are only
in the <a href="#parent">parent</a> of the current problem, and may
only be `Submit'ed.
<p>
A <b id='.run-file'>.run file</b> is just a list of .in files
from which .score files may be computed.  A .run file can be uploaded
on the <a href="#problem-page">Problem Page</a>,
and pushed along with other files to a project
by the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
When a project is pulled, most .run files are left in the problem's
parent and can only be `submitted', but sample run files are linked
from the problem's own directory to the parent, and can only be `run'.
The exact differences between a run and a submit are described at the end
of this section.
<p>
Both runs and submits are referred to as `run's.
A run produces for each .in file an associated .score file.
During the run, and after it is over, the Run Page displays for each
.in/.score pair a line giving the .in/.score files'
common base name and the CPU execution
times for the various sub-computations
needed to compute the .score file from the .in file.
These times are marked
as follows:
</p>
<div class='indented'>
<table>
<tr><td>g1:</td><td>generate program making input for solution</td></tr>
<tr><td>s:</td><td>solution making .sout file from generated input</td></tr>
<tr><td>g2:</td><td>generate program making input for filter program</td></tr>
<tr><td>f:</td><td>filter program making .fout file from .sout file and generated input</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
The Run Page lists all the .run files in a table, one file per line.
For the last run of a particular .run file,
the associated run output, or .rout file is given.
If there is also a non-empty run error, or .rerr
file, it is also listed.  These files can be displayed in an
<a href='#aux-window'>auxiliary window</a>
by clicking on their name, and can be downloaded by holding
the control key down while clicking on their name.
<p>
The objective of run is to produce a `Score' for the total run
that is listed in the run's
output .rout file.   Sometimes no score can be produced, and none is
listed.  The most frequent cause of this is failure to upload a problem
solution on the Problem Page before attempting the run.
<p>
The differences between a `Run' of a
a .run file in your directory and a `Submit' of a .run file
in the parent of your directory are as follows.  During a
submit, all files used are in the parent, and not your local
directory, except for your solution executable.  During a run,
files in your local directory override those in the parent.
After a submit that produces a `Score', the .rout file is recorded as a submit
result in the parent (project) problem directory, where every user
can view it (using the <a href='#view-page'>View Page</a>).
The .rout file is also recorded in your problem directory
for a submit that produces a `Score'.
After a non-submit run that produces a `Score', the .rout file
is only recorded in your problem directory where only you can
view it.
<p>
Lastly, after a submit that produces a `Score' that is not
`Completely Correct', .in and .ftest files of the first failed
test case will be linked into your problem directory so you
can debug against them without re-submitting, provided that
you have `first-failed' privilege for the project problem.
</p>

<h1 id="option-page">Option Page</h1>

<p>The <b>Option Page</b> shows the options given to
commands that perform compilations and computations,
and allows you to edit these options within limits.
<p>
For example, the allowed maximum size of the virtual memory
when a problem solution program is executing is an
option, as is the allowed maximum size of any file output
by the solution.
<p>
There are two kinds of options: <a href='#option-numbers'>numbers</a>
and <a href='#option-arguments'>arguments</a>.  Numbers are substituted
into arguments, and arguments are substituted into the commands
used to make one file from another file.
These commands are specified by templates, which  can be
displayed by clicking the `View Templates' button to display
the <a href='#template-page'>Template Page</a> in
a separate <a href='#aux-window'>auxiliary window</a>.
<p>
There are two values for each option: an <b>inherited value</b>
and a <b>local value</b>.  The inherited value is set by
the <a href='#parent'>parent</a> of the current problem,
and cannot be changed (without pushing a new options files to the
parent).  The local value, when given, overrides the inherited value.
In displays, local values are colored green and inherited values
are colored tan.
Note that parent .run file submissions use only inherited option values,
whereas current problem .run file runs use local overrides.
<p>
As with other pages, clicking on a &uarr; will hide a section
of the page and clicking on a &darr; will display the section.
<p>
You can switch back and forth between just viewing options and
editing them by clicking buttons at the top of the Option Page.
When editing you can also reset all options to their inherited
values.
</p>

<h2 id="option-numbers">Number Options</h2>
<p>
<b>Number options</b> are numbers included in argument
options.  For example, the STIME option value is the maximum number of
CPU seconds allowed a C/C++ problem solution program, whereas
SJTIME is the maximum allowed a JAVA
solution program, and SPTIME is the maximum allowed a PYTHON program.
<p>
If you edit an inherited number option, its value will
turn green, even if you input the same value as the inherited
value.  Clicking the &#8635; symbol after the value will restore
the value to the inherited value (and restore the color to tan).
</p>

<h2 id="option-arguments">Argument Options</h2>
<p>
<b>Argument options</b> are the arguments that
are inserted into <a href='#template-page'>template commands</a>.
For each such option there
are discrete choices (for some argument options there is no
choice and the single value is `required').
<p>
<a href='#option-numbers'>Option numbers</a>
are inserted into argument options.  For example,
the STIME number option is inserted into the
`-cputime STIME' value of the SSTIME argument option.
The SSTIME argument in turn is
inserted into the template commands that run a C/C++ solution program,
so that the options work together with the commands to determine
the maximum number of CPU seconds
allowed a C/C++ solution program.
<p>
The absence of any value for an option command argument is represented by
an empty box.
If there are two colored boxes, the
one colored green is the current value and is local, and the one
colored tan is inherited.
If only one box is colored,
the option value is inherited, even if the box is colored green
(it is green because you are editing and have clicked on the inherited value).
</p>

<h1 id="template-page">Template Page</h1>
<p>
A <b>Template</b> supplies the commands used to make one
file from another file.
Templates can be displayed in a separate
<a href='#aux-window'>auxiliary window</a>
by clicking the `View Templates' button on
the <a href='#option-page'>Option Page</a>.
<p>
An index of all the available templates is displayed at the top
of the page.  Clicking on the box next to a template name
displays or hides the relevant contents of the template.
<p>
The commands displayed for a template are executed when the
template is used.  These contain argument names substituted 
from the <a href='#option-arguments'>argument options</a>.
Each substitutable argument name is preceded in its command by a dollar
sign ($).
In addition to argument option substitutions, the problem
name is substituted for PPPP, and the remainder of the source file name
is substituted for other sequences of 4 consecutive capital
letters, such as XXXX or YYYY.
<p>
The template selected for a particular
task is controlled by the extensions of the input and output
files, but also by what other files are available.  For example,
several templates are available to make a .score file with
a score from an .in file with solution input.  One of these
is selected if there is a binary file with no extension
(for C or C++);
another is selected if there is a binary file with the .jar
extension (for JAVA); and a third is selected if there is a binary
file with the .pyc extension (for PYTHON).
Files which are required to use a
template are call the <b>required files</b> of the template.
<p>
A template allows some required files to be <b>creatable</b>.
These are automatically
created from defaults if they do not exist.  For example, the
generate_PPPP program will be created from a default that does
nothing but strip comments from a .in file to make a .sin file.
<p>
A template requires some files to be <b>local</b>, that is, not
in the <a href='#parent'>parent</a> of the current problem.
Other files are required to be
<b>remote</b>, that is, they <u>must</u> be in the parent of the
current problem (i.e., in a project).
Lastly many required files can be either local or
remote.  When a creatable file is created, it is always created
locally, so it must not be a remote required file.
<p>
In addition the template selected is controlled by <b>conditions</b>.
For example, to be used during the upload of a PPPP.cc file, a
template must have the `UPLOAD PPPP.cc' condition.
As another example, a template used when a .run file is submitted
must have the `SUBMIT' condition.
Much of the time only templates with no conditions are selected.
<p>
After commands created by a template are executed, the list
of <b>checks</b> defined by the template are processed.  Each
check has the form [f1,f2,...] for file names f1, f2, ..., or the
check is a single file name f which is equivalent to [f].
For all the checks but the last, the check is ignored if f1
does not exist or has zero size.  Generally f1 is an error file.
If a check that is not the last is NOT ignored, then `f1 is not empty'
is added to the error messages for the execution, and the first two
showable files in the list f1, f2, ... are automatically shown.
<p>
The last check differs in that it is ignored only if the execution
has errors, and otherwise is the list of files to be automatically
shown.
<p>
Finally the template specifies a <b>keep</b> list of files that
are to be kept if there are no errors in an execution.
</p>

<h1 id="list-page">List Page</h1>
<p>
A problem list is just a list of problems that are either
your problems or project problems.  The `Your Problems'
list is automatically created and lists all of your problems
(including those pulled from or pushed to a project).
The `public Problems' list is automatically created and lists
all problems in the <a href='#public'>public</a> project.
It is an example of a project problem list.
<p>
The automatically created lists can get too long to be useful,
so you can create shorter lists of your own, and publish them
so others can use them.  Each published list is associated with
a project.
<p>
The list of problem lists can also become too long, so
you have a `favorites list' that is a list of the problem lists
you are interested in.  The favorites list can be edited via
the <a href=#favorites-page>Favorites Page</a>.  When you
are asked to select a problem list, the list of problem lists
presented for selection is always the favorites list.
<p>
The favorites list is initialized to include `Your Problems'
plus all <a href='#published'>published</a> problem lists.
When a problem list is published (by anyone), it will be automatically
added to your favorites list; but you can remove it from your favorites
list after it has been automatically added, even if it remains published.
<p>
The List Page allows you to view and edit two problem lists
(colored tan and blue).  Two lists are allowed so you can
move problems from one to the other.  You can use `Select List'
in either the tan or blue list header to select a tan or blue list.
<p>
At any time you can make a new list that is a copy of a
currently selected list.  If the selected list has been changed
by editing, the changes will be reflected in the copy.  If
there is no currently selected list, you can make a new empty list.
When a new list is created, it is added to the beginning of the
favorites list.
<p>
Once selected, if the list is your
list, you can reorder the list by dragging problems to the
location just above where you want to drop them.  You can
remove problems from the list and un-remove them by clicking
the oval next to the problem.  The problems with black ovals
are in the list, and those with white ovals have been removed
(but could be put back in by clicking their ovals).
<p>
If you have selected two problem lists, you can drag a problem
from one list to the other.
<p>
Lists that are not your own cannot be changed.  If you drag
a problem from such a list to a list of your own, the problem
will be copied to the destination list.
<p>
If you drag a problem from one of your own lists to another of
your own lists, the problem will be moved; that is, it will be
removed from its source list while being added to its destination
list.  If, however, you hold down the control key while dragging
the list, it will be copied and not moved; that is, the problem
will be left in the source list while being added to the destination
list.
<p>
After editing a list of your own, you must `SAVE' it.  `FINISH'
will also save the list and in addition will de-select the list so you
can select another list.  `CANCEL' will de-select the list without
saving it.  `RESET' will reset the list to its state before
you changed it, and `DELETE' will delete the list completely.
<p>
For an selected list of your own that has not been edited, `CANCEL' will
de-select the list and `DELETE' will delete the list completely.
</p>

<h2 id="list-descriptions">List Descriptions</h2>
<p>
Each list has an optional associated <a href='#descriptions'>description</a>.
If a selected, un-changed list of your own is named XXXX, then its description
should be in one of your files named XXXX.dsc, and you may upload that file.
Uploading a description file immediately stores the files
contents in the list.
<p>
You can delete a list description by uploading an empty .dsc file.
</p>

<h2 id="publishing-lists">Publishing Lists</h2>
<p>
You can publish one of your lists to a project using the
`PUBLISH' button.  This moves or copies your list to the project.
You can unpublished a project list using the `UNPUBLISH' button.
This moves or copies a project list to one of your lists.
<p>
A <b id='published'>published</b>
list is visible to other users on their
<a href='#favorites-page'>Favorites Page</a>, so these other users
can include your list in their favorites.  An unpublished list is
not visible to other users.
<p>
When you publish a list, it is automatically added to the favorites
list of all users, but they can remove it from their favorites list
after it has been automatically added.
<p>
You must have the `show' privilege for a project in order for you to be
able to see its problem list and any of its published lists.
To publish to a project, you must have either `publish-all' privilege,
or you must have the `publish-own' privilege AND the list name
must end with `&#8209;&#8209;AAAA' where AAAA is your account name (note there
are TWO `-'s).  Similarly to unpublish a project list, you must
have either `unpublish-all' privilege,
or you must have the `unpublish-own' privilege AND the list name
must end with `&#8209;&#8209;AAAA'.
</p>

<h2 id="descriptions">Descriptions</h2>
<p>
Description files contain paragraphs separated by blank lines.
There are three kinds of paragraphs: headed, indented, and ordinary.
<p>
A headed paragraph begins with a `*'; its first input line
with the `*' removed is made boldface; and then the paragraph is
output as an HTML &lt;p&gt; paragraph with all output lines but the first
slightly indented.
<p>
An indented paragraph begins
with a single space or tab and is output in monospace font
as an HTML &lt;pre&gt; paragraph with spaces and line ends preserved.
<p>
An ordinary paragraph does not begin with a `*', space, or tab, and
is output as a plain HTML &lt;p&gt; paragraph.
<p>
Each tab is replaced by exactly 8 spaces before the above processing
is done.  A sequence of tabs at the beginning of a line will therefore
space correctly with tab stops set every 8 columns, but tabs embedded
inside a line will not space correctly.
<p>
The characters &lt; and &gt; will output as is, unless they are
part of one of the following HTML tags which are allowed and
recognized anywhere in the text:
<p>
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>&lt;br&gt;</td><td>Line Break</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;b&gt;</td><td>Begin Bold</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;/b&gt;</td><td>End Bold</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;i&gt;</td><td>Begin Italic</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;/i&gt;</td><td>End Italic</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Tags are NOT case-sensitive.
Whitespace is not allowed inside tags.
The text may contain &amp;...; representations
of characters; e.g., &amp;amp; for &amp;.
</p>

<h1 id="favorites-page">Favorites Page</h1>
<p>
The `Favorites' list is a list of those problem lists
you find most interesting, in order of interest.
Whenever you are asked to select a problem list, it is
the favorites list that is given as the list of available problem
lists.
<p>
This Favorites Page allows you to edit the favorites list.
It displays all the lists that can be on the
Favorites list, each with an oval that is black
for those problem lists that are on the Favorites list.
and white for other lists.
The black oval lists are in the order that they appear in
the Favorites list.  Lists created by users may also have an
attached description created by their author and displayed just
after the list name.
<p>
If you click on a oval it toggles between black and
white.  In either case
its list is moved to the boundary between black and white
lists, so the black lists are always above the white
lists.
<p>
You can change the order of lists by dragging a list
to a second list below which you want the first list to be.
To move a list to the top, drag it to the `Favorites' title
line.
<p>
When you first alter the favorites list, the `Go To ... Page'
buttons are replaced by `SAVE' and `RESET' buttons.
Changes you make are not recorded until you click `SAVE'.
Clicking `RESET' restores Favorites to its previous state.
You must use one of these two buttons to get the `Go To ... Page'
</p>

<h1 id="contest-page">Contest Page</h1>
<p>
The Contest Page defines a programming contest in which
contestants try to solve as many problems as they can in limited time.
<p>
In a 1-phase contest, the judges make the problems, and in a
2-phase contest, each contestant makes one problem and the scoreboard
separately scores problems according to how well they split the field
of contestants (for the perfect problem, exactly 50% of contestants
get the problem).
<p>
A contestant is an account: it can be an individual account or a team
account.
<p>Besides contestants, a contest has managers and judges.  A manager
registers contest contestants, judges, and other managers, and generally
manages which accounts are in the contest and what role each plays.  Judges
can test the contest problems before the contest proper.
</p>

<h2 id="contest-participation">Contest Participation</h2>
<p>
To register for a contest, so you can participate,
go to the Contest Page and select
the contest you want to participate in.  Contests are not advertised
on EPM so you must find out about the contest by other means.
<p>
Then send an email registration request to the 'To Register, Email' address.
You must have an EPM account and send the mail from an email address that
you have associated with your EPM account.  If you are on a team,
it will be unclear which EPM account you want to register, your
individual account or one of your team accounts, so in this case be sure to
include the name of the account you want to register in your email.
<p>
After you have registered, you may solve problems during and after
the solution period: that is, the time between the Problem Solution
Submit Start and Stop Times.  Only submissions before the Stop Time
will appear on the scoreboard.  The contest is also a project;
after the Start Time you should be able to see a list of problems for
the project and will be able to pull and submit
these problems.  Before the Start Time you will NOT be able to see
the list or pull problems.
<p>
For a 2-phase contest you also have to make a problem.  Between
the Problem Definition Submit Start and Stop Times you can push
a problem to the contest project.  You will not be able to see
a list of the project problems during this time, and will NOT
be able to pull any problems from the project, even your own,
should you delete your own version of your problem.  So do NOT
delete your version of your problem until after the contest.
<p>
Also, during the Solution Submit Times you can submit your
solution to your own problem, thus getting at least one problem
on the Solution Scoreboard.
</p>

<h2 id="contest-judging">Contest Judging</h2>
<p>
A contest judge can pull and submit problems from the
contest project anytime.  A judge can thus test the problems
anytime.
<p>
In a 1-phase contest, a contest judge can push problems
to the contest project between
the Problem Definition Submit Start and Stop Times.
In this time interval, a judge can pull a problem written
by another judge and test it, but cannot re-push it.
</p>

<h2 id="contest-managing">Contest Managing</h2>
<p>
The contest manager must register contest participant
accounts
using email addresses from which registration requests
are sent
( see <a href="#contest-participation">Contest Participation</a> above).
After registering an account, a manager selects roles for the account:
contestant (C), judge (J), or manager (M).
To change a role, hover over the role box at the left of the
account line: the new role value will appear, and if you click the box
the role value will be changed to this new value.  If you do NOT
click the box, the value will not be changed.
<p>
An account can have more than one role, or no roles.
There can be more than one manager.
<p>
A manager can cancel an account role,
in which case the C, J, or M will be drawn with a line
through it to indicate the account once had the role
but a manager cancelled it.  A role can be restored
and re-cancelled by a manager any number of times.  An account
cannot be removed from the contest, but all its roles can
be cancelled, which has the same effect.
<p>
There can be more than one manager.  A manager cannot perform
as a judge or contestant unless the manager account is given
the J or C role in addition to the M role.
<p>
A manager must set the contest parameters.  Until the Contest
Description, Contest Type, Problem Definition Submit Times,
and `To Register, Email' email address are set, the contest
is not `deployed' and its project cannot be used by contestants
or judges.  The Problem Solution Submit Times can be set
later, after the contest has been deployed.  Until the
Problem Solution Submit Times are set, only judges can submit
solutions.
<p>
If parameters are reset, the contest will be redeployed.  If
parameters required for deployment are cancelled,
the contest will NOT be redeployed with new parameters.
</p>

<h1 id="view-page">View Page</h1>
<p>
The View Page allows you to see lists of actions that involve
an account, a project, a problem, or the published lists.
<p>
To view actions involving an account select the account.
<p>
To view actions involving a project select the project.
<p>
To view actions involving a problem, first select a problem
list, and then select a problem from that list.
<p>
The actions are displayed as action lists.
The actions are generally self explanatory.  For the submit
actions, the 3 decimal digit number followed immediately
by `s' is the maximum solution execution time in seconds.
<p>
You can filter the actions displayed by entering a logical
expression which must be satisfied by each action displayed.
This logical expression uses keywords in the action, which
are pretty much any significant word in the action.
The logical expression syntax is:
<table style='margin-left:5em'>
<tr><td>logical expression ::= term { whitespace term }*</td></tr>
<tr><td>term ::= factor { '&amp;' factor }*</td></tr>
<tr><td>factor ::= keyword | '-' keyword</td></tr>
</table>
A keyword factor is true iff the keyword is in the action.
A `-keyword' factor is true iff the keyword is NOT in the action.
&amp; denotes logical AND, and whitespace denotes logical OR.
There are NO parentheses.  Note that terms cannot contain
whitespace.
<p>
Projects for which you do not have view privilege will NOT be
visible on the View Page.  Such projects are usually used
to prepare programming contest problems.
</p>

<h1 id="manage-page">Manage Page</h1>
<p>
The Manage Page allows you to view root, project, and project problem
privileges, and to change any one of these for which you have owner privilege.
Then if you have appropriate privileges,
the Manage Page also allows
you to download gzipped tar files of problems and projects,
to copy problems between projects,
to copy projects to other projects
(effectively changing the name of a project),
to block a problem in a project, so it cannot be accessed, or
to block a project, so none of its problems can be accessed.
<p>
On the Manage Page you begin by selecting either a project or a
problem, or neither.
<p>
When you select a project, the privilege file of the project is
displayed, and if you have owner privilege for the project,
you can edit this file.
If you have download privilege for the
project, a button appears that allows you to
to download a .tgz tar file of the project contents.
If you have block privilege for the project, a button appears
which allows you to block the project.
If you have copy-from privileges for the project and copy-to
privileges for root, a field appears which allows you to enter
the name of a new project to which the project will be copied.
<p>
When you select a project (non-local) problem, the privilege file
of the project problem is displayed, and if you have owner privilege
for the project problem, you can edit this file.
If you have download privilege for the
project problem, a button appears that allows you to
to download a .tgz tar file of the project problem directory
within its project.
If you have block privilege for the project problem, a button appears
which allows you to block the project problem.
If you have copy-from privileges for the project problem and copy-to
privileges for other projects, a field appears which allows you to
select one of these other projects and copy the problem to that
other project.
<p>
When you select a non-project problem, a button appears that allows you
to download a .tgz tar file of the problem's local directory
(you need no privileges for this).
<p>
Blocking a project or project problem effectively deletes the
project or project problem.
When you block a project or project problem, you must supply
one or more lines of text giving the reason you are blocking
the project or project problem.  These will be displayed
when an account which has previously pulled a problem that
is blocked tries to do something with that problem.
If you have block privilege for the project or project problem,
and the project or project problem is already blocked, an
unblock button appears in place of the block button that
allows you to unblock the project or project problem.
<p>
The following are the possible project privileges:

<p>
You do not need privileges to download a .tgz tar file containing
the local directory contents for a problem.
<p>
To determine privileges, lines in privilege files are processed in
the order
<ol>
<li> the root privilege file lines
<li> project privilege file lines
<li> project problem privilege file lines, if the privileges
     of a project problem are being determined
     (as opposed to the privileges of just a project)
</ol>
<p>
If you select NEITHER a project or a problem, the root privilege
file is displayed, and if you have owner provileges in that file,
you can edit the file.
Root privileges are granted to EPM server administrators.
The possible root privileges are:
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>owner</td><td>allows administrator to edit the privilege files
                         </td></tr>
<tr><td>block</td><td>allows administrator to block projects and problems
		      </td></tr>
<tr><td>create&#8209;project</td><td>allows administrator to create projects
		     </td></tr>
<tr><td>copy&#8209;to</td><td>allows a project to be copied to a new project
		      </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A privilege file line is one of the following:
<ul>
<li> blank line; ignored
<li> comment line; first non-whitespace character is `#', ignored
<li> line of form `&lt;sign&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;matcher&gt;'
     <br>
     where
     <ul>
     <li> &lt;sign&gt; ::= `&lt;' | `&gt;'
     <li> &lt;time&gt; ::= &lt;date&gt;T&lt;time-of-day&gt; | `ALWAYS'
     <li> &lt;date&gt; ::= &lt;year&gt;-&lt;month&gt;-&lt;day&gt;
     <li> &lt;time-of-day&gt; ::= &lt;hour&gt;:&lt;minute&gt;&lt;time-zone&gt;
     <li> &lt;time-zone&gt; ::= `EST' | `EDT' | ...
     <li> &lt;matcher&gt; ::= &lt;regular-expression&gt; | &lt;group&gt;
     </ul>
     If this line matches, it sets the
     upper time bound (&lt;sign&gt; is `&lt;') or
     lower time bound (&lt;sign&gt; is `&gt;')
     for enabling privilege lines below.
     The time value `ALWAYS' disables the designated time bound
     (its always in the future for &lt; and always in the past
     for &gt;).
<li> line of form `&lt;sign&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;matcher&gt;'
     <br>
     where
     <ul>
     <li> &lt;sign&gt; ::= `+' | `-'
     <li> &lt;key&gt; ::= &lt;privilege&gt; | &lt;group&gt;
     <li> &lt;privilege&gt; ::= `owner' | ... 
              <div style='margin-left:2em'>
	      where &lt;privilege&gt; must be appropriate for the file
	      it is in (e.g., `re-push' is appropriate for a project
	      problem file but not a project file)
	      </div>
     <li> &lt;group&gt; ::=
              <div style='margin-left:2em'>
	      sequence of letters, digits, `_', `-', and `@'
	      which begins with a `@' followed by a letter,
	      has only one `@' (at its beginning), and ends with
	      a letter or digit
	      </div>
     </ul>
     <br>
     If this line matches and the current time is within the
     time bounds, the
     line assigns &lt;sign&gt; to &lt;key&gt; UNLESS
     &lt;key&gt; has previously been assigned.
</ul>
 <p>
 A &lt;regular-expression&gt; matches if it matches the
 current user ID.
 <br>
 A &lt;group&gt; matches if it has previously been assigned
 `+'.
 <br>
 Both time bounds are set to `ALWAYS' at the beginning of each
 privilege file.
<p>
If after all the privilege file lines are processed a privilege
has the value `+', the current user has the privilege.  Otherwise
the current user does NOT have the privilege.
<p>
Groups may be defined that are sets of users, or are
intersections, unions, or
set complements of previous groups.
