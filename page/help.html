<p>
EPM (the Educational Problem Manager) is intended to
make it easier for one user to develop a programming problem and
then make it available for other users to solve.
Problem development is mostly a matter of creating
test case input and output in a form suitable for automatic
scoring, and then debugging the problem solution and specification
against the test cases.
<p>
The following diagram specifies the data flow used to score
a test case for a problem named PPPP.  For simple problems,
generate-PPPP simply copies its input to its output removing
comments, and filter-PPPP simply copies its input to its
output (epm_score ignores comments).  In more complex cases
generate-PPPP uses commands from the .in file to generate
.sin solution input using a pseudo-random number generator,
and filter-PPPP analyzes the .sin and .sout files to produce
a summary used in scoring (e.g., it might read a graph from .sin
and check that a path in .sout is in fact a path in the graph,
outputting the path length if it is and an error message otherwise).

<a name="login-page"><h1>Login Page</h1></a>

<p>
The <b>login page</b> manages login using email addresses to
identify a user and confirmation numbers to create tickets for
the user in the user's browser.  Once you have logged in, an
EPM server session for your user ID is attached to your browser,
a browser ticket for future use is attached to you e-mail address,
and your e-mail
address is attached to your user ID.
<p>
Your session is allocated:
<ul>
<li> A <a name="main-tab">main tab</a> for non-problem-specific
actions.  This is allocated on login and after login is
loaded with the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
You should NOT close this tab while you are logged in.
<li> A <a name="problem-tab">problem tab</a> for each of your
problems.
These are created using the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
There can be at most one problem tab for each of your problems.
<li> A <a name="view-window">view popup window</a> for read-only
views of files and information.
<li> A <a name="help-window">help popup window</a> for this
help page and the User Guide page.
</ul>
<p>
EPM consists of a set of pages, such as the Login Page and the
Project Page.  Each of these is assigned to a tab or window.
The Table of Contents gives the tab or window of each page in []
brackets after the entry for the page; for example, after the Login
Page one sees [main], indicating that the Login Page runs in the `main' tab.
<p>
If you close the main tab by mistake, create a new tab and load
it with the EPM server URL (that you used for logging in).
Do NOT attempt to use an analogous method to create any other
tabs or popup windows for your login session; use the buttons
that create these instead.
<p>
To change
the user ID of a session you must explicitly log out,
and then you must log back in.  Logging out should close any
problem tabs and popup windows that you have.
<p>
An account is on an <a name='EPM-server'>EPM server</a>.
EPM servers are named
by the document root URL used to access them, and EPM servers with
different names are independent of each other (even
if they are running on the same computer).
</p>

<a name="login-email"><h2>User Email Address</h2></a>
<p>
You can have up to 3 <b>email addresses</b> that map to your
user ID, and hence to your account on the EPM server.
Confirmation numbers will be sent to these email addresses
in order to create <a href="#browser-ticket">Browser Tickets</a>.
<p>
If you are making a new account, enter an appropriate
email address.  After entering the confirmation number sent
to that address, you will be routed to the
<a href="#user-page">User Page</a> to complete the process
of establishing a new account.
</p>

<a name="browser-ticket"><h2>Browser Ticket</h2></a>
<p>
A browser <b>ticket</b> is stored in the browser local memory
and enables a user to log in by giving only the email
address associated with ticket.  There is a separate
ticket for each <a href='#EPM-server'>EPM server</a>,
each browser, and
each email address used to log in to the EPM server.
<p>
When you first log in your browser has no ticket.  Therefore
the server emails you a ticket called a <b>confirmation number</b>,
which you enter into the browser.  The browser sends this
to the server, which logs the browser in.
<p>
Every time the browser sends a ticket to the server, if
the server accepts the ticket and logs the browser in,
then the server sends the broswer a replacement ticket.  A
ticket can be used only once.
<p>
When you first log in with a given email address,
your first <b>auto-login period</b> for that email address begins.
During this period the server accepts tickets associated
with the email address from browsers that have them.
At the end of this period
the server cancels all tickets associated with the
email address and emails you a confirmation number when you
request a new login.  The server also starts a new auto-login
period.  The first auto-login period is 2 days, the second
is 7 days, and all the rest are 30 days.
</p>

<a name="user-page"><h1>User Page</h1></a>

<p>
To be an EPM user you must supply the following information which
appears on the user page.

<p class='indented'>
<mark>NOTICE: All this information is PUBLIC in that it is
	       available to other users of the same EPM
	       server,
               except that current policy is that
	       the non-domain parts of email addresses
	       will be replaced by dots(...), e.g.,
	       jdoe@gurgle.com will become `...@gurgle.com'.

<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
<li><strong>User ID</strong>:<p class='list'>
A short name by which you will be known.
Must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin a letter, end with a letter or digit, and have at least 4 characters.
For privacy, you may wish to choose an ID that is NOT
part of your e-mail address.
<mark>NOTICE: Once you have created your account, you
CANNOT CHANGE your user ID!</mark>
<li><strong>Full Name</strong>:<p class='list'>
Your full name, so that you can be looked up on the web.
<li><strong>Organization</strong>:<p class='list'>
An organization you are associated with, so you can be
looked up in the context of this organization.
If you are not closely associated with an organization,
such as a university, you may use an organization
such as the ACM or if nothing more limited is available, Facebook.
<li><strong>Location</strong>:<p class='list'>
The location of your organization, e.g., town, state, and
country, or if the organization is nebulous, like the ACM
or Facebook, your own location.
<li><strong>Email Addresses</strong>:<p class='list'>
You must have one or more email addresses associated with
your account.  You use these to log into the account.
It is well to have two or more, in case you lose access to
one of them.
</ul>
</p>


<a name="project-page"><h1>Project Page</h1></a>
<p>
A project is a collection of problems which may be solved
by EPM users.  Before solving a problem in a project, a user pulls
the problem.  A use may also write their own new problem that does
not belong to any project, and when done, the user
may elect to push that problem to a project so other users can pull the
problem and try to solve it.
<p>
Two builtin projects are `<a name='demos'>demos</a>',
which contains demonstration
problems, and `<a name='public'>public</a>',
into which anyone may push problems
they have developed.
<p>
The project page lets you:
<ul>
<li> pull a problem you want to solve from a project
<li> create a new problem of your own that is not in a project
<li> create a problem tab for any of your own problems
     <br>
     (whether they have been pulled or created by you)
<li> push a problem you have written into a project
</ul>
<p>
To pull a problem from a project, first select the problem
list of the project, which will have a name such as
`public Problems' or `demos Problems'.  Then click the
<b>Pull</b> button, check the ovals of the problems you wish to pull,
and click
the <b>Submit</b> button.  Details are at
<a href="#project-pull">Pulling Problems</a>.
<p>
To creat a tab for one of your own problems, first
select a problem list that contains the desired problem,
such as the `Your Problems' list that contains all your
problems.  Then select the problem from the
`<b>Create Tab for Problem</b>' list.
<p>
To create a new problem of your own, simply type its name
into the `<b>Create a New Problem</b>' box.  The name
must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin with a letter, and end with a letter or digit.  If you plan to publish
this problem in a project, you should choose a name distinct
from other problem names already in the project.
<p>
You should understand that when you create a problem of
your own, the master copies of the problem files remain on
your own computer.  These files are uploaded to the EPM
server, but the uploaded copies may not
be preserved, and cannot be downloaded.
<p>
Pushing problems is done in a manner similar to pulling
them: see <a href="#project-push">Pushing Problems</a>
for details.
<p>
When you pull or push a problem, the problem ends up in
both a directory private to you, as `Your' problem, and
in a directory within a project.  The project problem
directory is known as the <a name='parent'>parent</a>
of your problem directory.  Your problem directory will
then contain symbolic links to files in its parent.
However, solution program files are only in your problem
directory, and NOT in its parent.
<p>
You can make your own problem lists, and publish them
so others can use them.  To do this click the
`<b>Edit Lists</b>' button on the Projects Page.  See
<a href='#list-page'>List Page</a> for details.
<p>
The list of problem lists on the Projects Page is known
as the Favorites List.  This Favorites List can be edited to include or
exclude various problem lists by clicking the
`<b>Edit Favorites</b>' button on the Projects Page.
See <a href='#favorites-page'>Favorites Page</a> for
details.
<p>
You will likely not have access to all projects.  You will be
able to pull problems from `demos', but NOT push problems to it.
You will be able to both pull problems from and push problems to `public'.
Projects you have no access to will not be visible on the
Projects Page.
</p>

<a name="project-pull"><h2>Pulling Problems</h2></a>
<p>
If you want to solve a problem that someone else has written,
you must pull the problem from a project.  Pulling a problem
creates a local directory for the problem, that is, your own
private local directory for the problem, and then creates links
in this directory to files in the project problem directory.
Only some files are linked in this manner.  You have to upload
a executable solution to your local directory to do things
like making score files.
<p>
Note that if you wrote and pushed the problem, so the project
problem is yours and not someone else's, all the project problem
files will be linked into your local directory, rather than
just those you should have to try to solve the problem.
<p>
To pull problems, in the Project Page
select a problems list and click `<b>Pull</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to pull.
Lastly, click <b>Submit</b>.  If all of the problems pull successfully,
the pulled problem ovals will turn green, a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can go to the Project Page or one of the
other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
Checked problems are pulled in the order they appear in the list.
If there is an error or warning pulling a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pulling.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the pull actions.
<p>
If you want to see the actions that will be taken to pull
a problem, check the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' button before
you `<b>Submit</b>'.  You will be shown the list of actions needed
to pull the problem and
asked whether or not to execute them or skip to the next
problem or cancel all pulling.  The problem's oval will become
red while you are deciding what to do about the actions.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pulled,
yellow if the problem was skipped because errors were detected
in compiling the problem's pull actions (no actions were actually
performed),
and white if the problem was skipped over.
</p>

<a name="project-push"><h2>Pushing Problems</h2></a>
<p>
If you have written your own problem, you can make it
available for others to solve by pushing the problem
into a project, such as the <a href='#public'>public</a>
project.  Then others can <a href='#project-pull'>pull</a>
your problem from the `public' project and try to solve it.
<p>
To push a problem to a project you must have `push-new' privilege
for the project.  You may re-push a problem you have previously
pushed in order to update it.  To re-push you must have `re-push'
privilege for the project problem.  When you initially push a problem,
and thereby create the project problem, you are given `owner'
and `re-push' privileges for the project problem.
<p>
When you push a problem, files in your local problem directory
are moved to its parent project problem directory and links are
made in your local problem directory to these moved files.
One consequence of this is that all runs you do for the problem
will be local, and you will not be able to submit the problem.
However your local runs give results identical to submissions
(they just are not recorded as submissions), as long
as you have not replaced any local links by updated files.
If you do replace local links by updated files, you may want
to re-push after you have finished testing the updates.
<p>
If you delete a file link in your local problem directory
whose target is a file the parent directory, executions are likely to still
work as in most cases a file will be taken from either the
local directory or the parent, with the local directory
peferred for non-submissions, and the parent version required
for non-solution-executables for submissions.
If you delete a local problem directory link of a .run file,
you will find that you an now submit the file.  If you
want to restore local links you have deleted, you may do
so by pulling the problem.
<p>
To push problems, in the Project Page select a problems list
and click `<b>Push</b>'.
Then check the ovals for the problems you want to push and
if some of these problems have not previously been pushed,
use `<b>Select Project</b>' to select the project to push
the problems into.  Lastly, click `<b>Submit</b>'.
For each problem you will be shown the list of actions needed
to push the problem and you will be given a choice as to whether
to execute these or skip the problem or cancel all pushing.
While you are deciding, the oval of the problem being processed
is red.
If you do not want to see these actions and be given this choice,
uncheck the `<b>Check Proposed Actions</b>' oval.
<p>
If there is an error or warning pushing a problem, 
messages will be displayed and you will be given a choice
on how to proceed.  You can skip to the next problem or cancel
all pushing.  For warnings, you can ignore the warning and
execute the push actions.
<p>
When all of the problems to be pushed have been processed,
a `<b>Done!</b>' message
will appear, and when you have finished looking at the colors
of the problem ovals, you can go to the Project Page or one of the
other pages that share the `main' tab with the Project Page.
<p>
At the end a problem's oval will be green if it was successfully
pushed, yellow if there were errors while executing the push
actions for the problem, and white if no push actions were executed
for the problem.
</p>

<a name="problem-page"><h1>Problem Page</h1></a>

<p>
The Project Page, which runs in the <a href="#main-tab">main tab</a>,
can be used to create a <a href="#problem-tab">problem tab</a>
containing the Problem Page for each of your problems.
The Problem Page performs common operations for a problem.
At any given time a problem tab contains either the Problem Page,
or the <a href="#run-page">Run Page</a>
which executes problem submissions and sample runs, or the
<a href="#option-page">Option Page</a> which can be used to
edit execution options.
<p>
You can have several problem tabs
at one time.  However two different problem tabs must be for
different problems.
<p>
The Problem and Run Pages in a problem tab
may run background jobs that take a while to execute, and
while a background job is running for a problem, you cannot
do anything else with that problem.  But you can work on a
DIFFERENT problem, which will be in a different problem tab.
</p>

<a name="problem-names"><h2>Problem Names</h2></a>
<p>
A <a name='problem-name'><b>problem name</b></a>
can contain only letters, digits, and the
special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>).
In addition, it must begin with a letter and end with a letter or digit.
</p>

<a name="problem-marks"><h2>Problem Marks</h2></a>
<p>
On the problem page:
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>&darr;</td><td>means `show below'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&uarr;</td><td>means `hide' (don't `show below')</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>&Chi;</pre></td><td>means `toggle overstrike of file name';
overstuck files are deleted when you `Delete Over-Struck Files'
or upload or make a new file or make a new link</td></tr>

</table>
</p>

<a name="current-problem-files"><h2>Current Problem Files</h2></a>
<p>
The <b>current problem files</b> are the files that you have uploaded
or made for the problem, plus links to other files.
These files and links are stored in your problem
directory and can be viewed, used, or deleted.  They are displayed
in the `Current Problem File' table, one line per file or link.
<p>
Current problem <a name='file-names'><b>file names</b></a> must have particular
<a href='#file-extensions'>extensions</a> that specify their role within
the problem.  The rest of a file name can contain
only letters, digits, and the special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>), must begin with a letter or digit, and must
end with the <a href='#problem-name'>problem name</a>, which if it is
preceded by anything must be preceded by a
dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>).
<p>
Link names follow the same rules as file names, and furthermore
each link name has the same extension as the file to which it is
linked.  For example, files imported from the
<a href="#parent">parent</a> of a problem are actually links
in your problem directory to the actual file in the parent directory.
In general links are treated and talked about as if they were files.
<p>
Clicking on a file name, if it is a button,
will show the file with line numbers
in a separate window.
<p>
Clicking on &darr; will show the file below.
<p>
Files that are a single short line cannot be shown but their contents
are displayed in <pre.inline>{ }</pre> brackets at the end of the
file's line.
<p>
Empty files and binary files cannot be shown but their nature is
displayed at the end of the file's line.
<p>
Displayable files must be encoded in UTF-8 or PDF.
PDF files can only be displayed by clicking on the file name.
A UTF-8 file that is displayable has its number of lines indicated
at the end of the file's line.
Only if this number of lines is small enough does the file have
a &darr; that permits the file to be displayed below.
<p>
If a file has been pushed to or pulled from a
<a href='#project-page'>project</a>, the
file itself is not in your problem directory, but is
in the project's problem directory and is linked to your problem
directory.  These are marked by `(Linked to PROJECT)' at
the end of the file's line.  None of these files are executable.
<p>
Executable files and source files for executables
may be links in your problem directory.
If they are links to a project <a href="#parent">parent</a>
directory file they are marked `Link to PROJECT-NAME project'.
If they are links to default EPM system files
(such as epm_default_generate)
they are marked as `Link to default'.  If they are links to
other files in your problem directory, they are marked as
`Link to FILE-NAME'.  This last only happens when you provide
multiple solutions to a problem: see <a href="#multiple-solutions">
Multiple Solutions</a> for details.
</p>

<a name="file-extensions"><h2>File Extensions</h2></a>
<p>
EPM files have <b>extensions</b> that indicate their format
and purpose.  In the following PPPP denotes the problem name
and XXXX denotes some other part of the name: for example,
the name XXXX-PPPP.in matches the name `00-001-reverser.in'
if XXXX is 00-001 and PPPP is `reverser'.
<p>
When a problem is pulled from a project, many of these files
of these files are supplied by the problem
<a href="#parent">parent</a>.  The pull may make links in your
problem directory to these files in the parent directory, or
the commands that make files from other files may read these
files directly from the parent directory.
<p>
The general scheme for producing a XXXX-PPPP.score file
containing a score from a XXXX-PPPP.in test case input file and
an executable solution PPPP is:
<pre style='display:block;font-size:14pt;margin-left:28px'>
generate-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sin
PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.in &gt;XXXX-PPPP.sout
filter-PPPP &lt;XXXX-PPPP.sin 3&lt;XXXX-PPPP.sout &gt;XXXX-PPPP.fout
epm_score XXXX-PPPP.fout XXXX-PPPP.ftest &gt;XXXX-PPPP.score
</pre>
<p>
The <a href="#generate-and-filter">generate-PPPP</a>
program takes the .in test case
input file and produces the .sin solution input file that is
input to the solution program <b>PPPP</b> to produce
the .sout solution output file.  Then both the solution output
and solution input file are input to the
<a href="#generate-and-filter">filter-PPPP</a>
program to produce the .fout filtered solution output.  Lastly the
<b>epm_score</b> program compares the .fout
filtered solution output to the .ftest test filtered
solution output provided by the judge to produce the .score file.
The actual commands used to execute all this are more complex
because the generate, solution, and filter programs are run in sandboxes,
as they are or may be uploaded.  The solution program is of course
provided by the problem solver, but the generate and filter
programs are provided by the problem setter (the person who
creates the problem).

<a name="generate-and-filter"><h2>Generate and Filter Programs</h2></a>
<p>
The generate, filter, monitor, and scoring programs all follow
the conventions that a line beginning `!!' is special, that
a .in input file a line beginning `!!##' is a comment line and
is removed so the solution never sees it,
and that .sout solution output lines beginning `!!**' are
comment lines that may be used for debugging output.
<p>
Other lines beginning with `!!' should only be used in .in input
files with generate programs that understand how to interpret them.
<p>
The default generate program simply copies its input to its output
removing lines beginning `!!##', which are considered comment lines.
If you are writting your own problem, you may write a generate
program (e.g., generate-PPPP.cc) that treats lines beginning with
`!!<some-leter>' as instructions to generate a sequence of
input lines, typically using a pseudo-random number generated
built into the generate program (so it cannot be changed later)
and seeded by a number in the input instruction line.
<p>
For example, `!!L SEED M N' could generate a line containing
M numbers randomly choosen in the range [1,N] with SEED being
the pseudo-random number generator seed.  Here `L' is the literal
letter L, and SEED, M, and N are natural number parameters.
<p>
The default filter program simply copies solution output
(which it gets from file descriptor 3) to its standard output.
The solution output can contain comments beginning `!!**'.
If you are writting your own problem, you may write a filter
program (e.g., filter-PPPP.cc) that computes data from the
solution input (output of the generate program) and the
solution output and replaces part of the solution output
with lines it produces.
<p>
For example, if the solution is supposed to produce a shortest path
in a graph, then the filter might check that the answer
is in fact a graph path, and replace the answer by the length
of the path.  The filter reads the solution input from its
standard input, file descriptor 0, to construct the graph, and
reads the solution input from file descriptor 3.
<p>
The epm_score scoring program treats any line beginning with
`!!' as a comment line, which it ignores.  If the default
generate program sees a line beginning with `!!' but NOT
`!!##', it treats it as a comment line and removes it,
but also issues a warning message on to its standard error
file.  Similarly if the default filter program sees a
solution output line beginning with `!!' but NOT `!!**',
it outputs the line but issues a warning message.
</p>

<a name="multiple-solutions"><h2>Multiple Solutions</h2></a>
<p>
If you are writting in the C language, so that normally you
would provide a solution PPPP.c, you may provide multiple
solutions named YYYY-PPPP.c, for various YYYY.  Then
after upload you will have files YYYY-PPPP and YYYY-PPPP.c
with `Link' buttons after them.  Clicking a `Link' button
for YYYY-PPPP will create a link PPPP&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;YYYY-PPPP,
and similarly the `Link' button for
for YYYY-PPPP.c will create a link PPPP.c&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;YYYY-PPPP.c.
This last is only useful if you are making something that
requires the source file, such as a .dout debugging file.
<p>
Other source languages behave similarly.
<p>
When a link is being created to an executable solution file, all
executable solution files are first deleted automatically.
This is a convenience feature, as if you have several executable
solutions for different programming languages, you cannot
make .score files and other files made with solution executables.
However this does not apply to solution source files: e.g.,
you can have PPPP.c and PPPP.java at the same time.
<p>
When choosing names YYYY-PPPP.c for your solutions, you must
avoid having YYYY end in `-generate', `-filter', or `-monitor',
as such files are treated not as solutions but as generate,
filter, or monitor programs.
</p>

<a name="problem-commands"><h2>Commands Last Executed</h2></a>
<p>
This section displays the UNIX/POSIX/LINUX commands last executed
to make a file, and if any files output by these commands are
kept in the problem directory, a list of kept files is also displayed.
<p>
Included is the CPU execution time in 0.001 second units of some of the
command lines.
<p>
If a command line fails, this is indicated along with a failure
message (but not for debugging runs that make .dout files which
contain their own failure messages, if any).
The indications take the form of footnotes marked by
<span class='notemark'>*</span>,
<span class='notemark'>**</span>,
<span class='notemark'>***</span>, etc.
</p>

<a name="problem-working"><h2>Working Files of Last Executed Commands</h2></a>
<p>
This section lists the files made by the last executed commands
which were <u>not</u> kept.  These files can be displayed in the
same manner as the files in the
<a href="#current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</a>
section.
<p>
Files that are kept on successful uploads or makes will
remain as (usually non-empty)
working files on unsuccessful uploads or makes.
<p>
Working files are deleted when a new set of commands is executed
or when a .run file is run.
</p>

<a name="run-page"><h1>Run Page</h1></a>
<p>
If you click a <b>Run</b> button on the problem page, the associated
.run file will be run and the page will switch to the Run Page where
the results will be displayed.
<p> The Run page displays both .run files that are listed on
the Problem Page, and may be `Run', and .run files that are only
in the <a href="#parent">parent</a> of the current problem, and may
only be `Submit'ed.
<p>
A <a name='.run-file'>.run file</a> is just a list of .in files
from which .score files may be computed.  A .run file can be uploaded
on the <a href="#problem-page">Problem Page</a>,
and pushed along with other files to a project
by the <a href="#project-page">Project Page</a>.
When a project is pulled, most .run files are left in the problem's
parent and can only be `submitted', but sample run files are linked
from the problem's own directory to the parent, and can only be `run'.
The exact differences between a run and a submit are described at the end
of this section.
<p>
Both runs and submits are referred to as `run's.
A run produces for each .in file an associated .score file.
During the run, and after it is over, the Run Page displays for each
.in/.score pair a line giving the .in/.score files'
common base name and the CPU execution
times for the various sub-computations
needed to compute the .score file from the .in file.
These times are marked
as follows:
</p>
<div class='indented'>
<table>
<tr><td>g1:</td><td>generate program making input for solution</td></tr>
<tr><td>s:</td><td>solution making .sout file from generated input</td></tr>
<tr><td>g2:</td><td>generate program making input for filter program</td></tr>
<tr><td>f:</td><td>filter program making .fout file from .sout file and generated input</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
The Run Page lists all the .run files in a table, one file per line.
For the last run of a particular .run file,
the associated run output, or .rout file is given.
If there is also a non-empty run error, or .rerr
file, it is also listed.  These files can be displayed with the &darr; button.
<p>
A run's .rout output file gives the `Score' for the run, and if not
`Completely Correct', gives the name of the first failed test case.
Also given are the maximum CPU execution times over all .in files
of the generate, solution, and filter programs.
<p>
The differences between a `Run' of a
a .run file in your directory and a `Submit' of a .run file
in the parent of your directory are as follows.  During a
submit, all files used are in the parent, and not your local
directory, except for your solution executable.  During a run,
files in your local directory override those in the parent.
After a submit, the .rout file is recorded as a submit
result in the parent (project) problem directory, where every user
can view it (using the <a href='#view-page'>View Page</a>).
After a run, the .rout file
is only recorded in your problem directory where only you can
view it.  The .rout file is also recorded in your problem directory
for a submit.
</p>

<a name="option-page"><h1>Option Page</h1></a>

<p>The <b>Option Page</b> shows the options given to
commands that perform compilations and computations,
and allows you to edit these options within limits.
<p>
For example, the allowed maximum size of the virtual memory
when a problem solution program is executing is an
option, as is the allowed maximum size of any file output
by the solution.
<p>
There are two kinds of options: <a href='#option-numbers'>numbers</a>
and <a href='#option-arguments'>arguments</a>.  Numbers are substituted
into arguments, and arguments are substituted into the commands
used to make one file from another file.
These commands are specified by templates, which  can be
displayed by clicking the `View Templates' button to display
the <a href='#template-page'>Template Page</a> in a separate window.
<p>
There are two values for each option: an <b>inherited value</b>
and a <b>local value</b>.  The inherited value is set by
the <a href='#parent'>parent</a> of the current problem,
and cannot be changed (without pushing a new options files to the
parent).  The local value, when given, overrides the inherited value.
In displays, local values are colored green and inherited values
are colored tan.
Note that parent .run file submissions use only inherited option values,
whereas current problem .run file runs use local overrides.
<p>
As with other pages, clicking on a &uarr; will hide a section
of the page and clicking on a &darr; will display the section.
<p>
You can switch back and forth between just viewing options and
editing them by clicking buttons at the top of the Option Page.
When editing you can also reset all options to their inherited
values.
</p>

<a name="option-numbers"><h2>Number Options</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Number options</b> are numbers included in argument
options.  For example, the STIME option value is the maximum number of
CPU seconds allowed a problem solution program.
<p>
If you edit an inherited number option, its value will
turn green, even if you input the same value as the inherited
value.  Clicking the &#8635; symbol after the value will restore
the value to the inherited value (and restore the color to tan).
</p>

<a name="option-arguments"><h2>Argument Options</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Argument options</b> are the arguments that
are inserted into <a href='#template-page'>template commands</a>.
For each such option there
are discrete choices (for some argument options there is no
choice and the single value is `required').
<p>
<a href='#option-numbers'>Option numbers</a>
are inserted into argument options.  For example,
the STIME number option is inserted into the
`-cputime STIME' value of the SSTIME argument option.
The SSTIME argument in turn is
inserted into the template command that runs the solution program,
so that the options work together with the command to determine
the maximum number of CPU seconds
allowed the solution program.
<p>
The absence of any value for an option command argument is represented by
an empty box.
If there are two colored boxes, the
one colored green is the current value and is local, and the one
colored tan is inherited.
If only one box is colored,
the option value is inherited, even if the box is colored green
(it is green because you have clicked on the inherited value).
</p>

<a name="template-page"><h1>Template Page</h1></a>
<p>
A <b>Template</b> supplies the commands used to make one
file from another file.
Templates can be displayed in a separate
window by clicking the `View Templates' button on
the <a href='#option-page'>Option Page</a>.
<p>
An index of all the available templates is displayed at the top
of the page.  Clicking on the box next to a template name
displays or hides the relevant contents of the template.
<p>
The commands displayed for a template are executed when the
template is used.  These contain argument names substituted 
from the <a href='#option-arguments'>argument options</a>.
Each substitutable argument name is preceeded in its command by a dollar
sign ($).
In addition to argument option substitutions, the problem
name is substituted for PPPP, and the reminder of the file names
is substituted for other sequences of 4 consecutive capital
letters, such as XXXX or YYYY.
<p>
The template selected for a particular
task is controlled by the extensions of the input and output
files, but also by what other files are available.  For example,
several tempates are available to make a .score file with
a score from an .in file with solution input.  One of these
is selected if there is a binary file with no extension
(for C or C++);
another is selected if there is a binary file with the .class
extension (for JAVA); and a third is selected if there is a binary
file with the .pyc extension (for PYTHON).
Files which are required to use a
template are call the <b>required files</b> of the template.
<p>
A template allows some required files to be <b>creatable</b>.
These are automatically
created from defaults if they do not exist.  For example, the
generate_PPPP program will be created from a default that does
nothing but strip comments from a .in file to make a .sin file.
<p>
A template requires some files to be <b>local</b>, that is, not
in the <a href='#parent'>parent</a> of the current problem.
Other files are required to be
<b>remote</b>, that is, they <u>must</u> be in the parent of the
current problem (i.e., in a project).
Lastly many required files can be either local or
remote.  When a creatable file is created, it is always created
locally, so it must not be a remote required file.
<p>
In addition the template selected is controlled by <b>conditions</b>.
For example, to be used during the upload of a PPPP.cc file, a
template must have the `UPLOAD PPPP.cc' condition.
As another example, a template used when a .run file is submitted
must have the `SUBMIT' condition.
Most of the time only templates with no conditions are selected.
</p>

<a name="list-page"><h1>List Page</h1></a>
<p>
A problem list is just a list of problems that are either
your problems or project problems.  The `Your Problems'
list is automatically created and lists all of your problems
(including those pulled from or pushed to a project).
The `public Problems' list is automatically created and lists
all problems in the <a href='#public'>public</a> project.
It is an example of a project problem list.
<p>
The automatically created lists can get too long to be useful,
so you can create shorter lists of your own, and publish them
so others can use them.
<p>
The list of problem lists can also become too long, so
you have a `favorites list' that is a list of the problem lists
you are interested in.  The favorites list can be edited via
the <a href=#favorites-page>Favorites Page</a>.  When you
are asked to select a problem list, the list of problem lists
presented for selection is always the favorites list.
The favorites list is initialized to include `Your Problems'
plus the automatically created problem lists of all projects
from which you are allowed to pull problems.
<p>
The List Page allows you to view and edit two problem lists
(colored tan and blue).  Two lists are allowed so you can
move problems from one to the other.
<p>
To create a problem list of your own, type its name into
either of the two `New Problem List Name' boxes on the List Page.
When it is created the list is added to the beginning of the
favorites list.
<p>
You can select either a tan or blue list by creating a new
list or selecting a list.  Once selected, if the list is your
list, you can reorder the list by dragging problems to the
location just above where you want to drop them.  You can
remove problems from the list and un-remove them by clicking
the oval next to the problem.  The problems with black ovals
are in the list, and those with white ovals have been removed
(but could be put back in by clicking their ovals).
<p>
If you have selected two problem lists, you can drag a problem
from one list to the other.
<p>
Lists that are not your own cannot be changed.  If you drag
a problem from such a list to a list of your own, the problem
will be copied to the destination list.
<p>
If you drag a problem from one of your own lists to another of
your own lists, the problem will be moved; that is, it will be
removed from its source list while being added to its destination
list.  If, however, you hold down the control key while dragging
the list, it will be copied and not moved; that is, the problem
will be left in the source list while being added to the destination
list.
<p>
After editing a list of your own, you must `SAVE' it.  `FINSH'
will also save the list and in addition will de-select the list so you
can select another list.  `CANCEL' will de-select the list without
saving it.  `RESET' will reset the list to its state before
you changed it, and `DELETE' will delete the list completely.
<p>
You can also `PUBLISH' an unpublished list and `UNPUBLISH' a published
list.  A published list is visible to other users on their
<a href='#favorites-page'>Favorites Page</a>, so these other users
can include your list in their favorites.  An unpublished list is
not visible.
</p>

<a name="list-descriptions"><h2>List Descriptions</h2></a>
<p>
If you have a list of your own named XXXX, then when you have
selected this list for editing, you may upload
a list description file named XXXX.dsc which contains a
description of your list.  This description is then visible
whenever the list is being considered for addition
to someone's favorites list.
<p>
You can delete a list description by uploading an empty .dsc file.
<p>
Description files contain paragraphs separated by blank lines.
There are two kinds of paragraphs: non-indented and indented.
A non-indented paragraph becomes a &lt;p&gt; HTML paragraph, and
is set with variable width font and automatic line breaks.
An indented paragraph becomes a &lt;pre&gt; HTML paragraph, and is
set with fixed width font and line breaks just where they
are in the .dsc file.
<p>
A list description file may NOT contain the characters
&lt; or &gt;, but may contain &amp;...;' representations
of characters; e.g., &amp;lt; for &lt;.
For indented paragraphs you may use
one or more tabs at the very beginning of a line, but nowhere
else.  Each tab will be replaced by 8 single space characters.
</p>

<a name="favorites-page"><h1>Favorites Page</h1></a>
<p>
The `Favorites' list is a list of those problem lists
you find most interesting, in order of interest.
Whenever you are asked to select a problem list, it is
the favorites list that is given as the list of available problem
lists.
<p>
This Favorites Page allows you to edit the favorites list.
It displays all the lists that can be on the
Favorites list, each with an oval that is black
for those problem lists that are on the Favorites list.
and white for other lists.
The black oval lists are in the order that they appear in
the Favorites list.  Lists created by users may also have an
attached description created by their author and displayed just
after the list name.
<p>
If you click on a oval it toggles between black and
white.  In either case
its list is moved to the boundary between black and white
lists, so the black lists are always above the white
lists.
<p>
You can change the order of lists by dragging a list
to a second list below which you want the first list to be.
To move a list to the top, drag it to the `Favorites' title
line.
<p>
When you first alter the favorites list, the `Go To ... Page'
buttons are replaced by `SAVE' and `RESET' buttons.
Changes you make are not recorded until you click `SAVE'.
Clicking `RESET' restores Favorites to its previous state.
You must then use one of these two buttons to get the `Go To ... Page'
buttons to reappear.
</p>

<a name="view-page"><h1>View Page</h1></a>
<p>
The View Page allows you to see information about all users
(not yet yourself), all project, and all problems.
<p>
To view information about a user select the user.
<p>
To view information about a project select the project.
<p>
To view information about a problem, first select a problem
list, and then select a problem from that list.
<p>
Much of the information is in the form of action lists.
You can exclude actions of particular types from these lists
by clicking the `Include Action Types' ovals to turn
white any action types you want to exclude.
<p>
The actions are generally self explanatory.  For the submit
actions, the 3 decimal digit number followed immediately
by `s' is the maximum solution execution time in seconds.
</p>

<a name="manage-page"><h1>Manage Page</h1></a>
<p>
The Manage Page allows you to view project and project problem
privileges, to change these if you have owner privilege for
a project or project problem, and to move problems between
projects.
<p>
By selecting a project, you an look at the privilege file
of the project, and if you have owner privilege for the project,
you can edit this file.  Similarly by selecting a problem list
and then a project problem, you can look at the privilege files of the
project problem and its project, and if you have owner privilege
for the project problem, you can edit the project problem file.
<p>
The following are the possible project privileges:
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>owner</td><td>allows user to edit the privileges of
                         the project</td></tr>
<tr><td>push&#8209;new</td><td>allows problems to be pushed to the project
                         if they are not already in the project</td></tr>
<tr><td>pull&#8209;new</td><td>allows a problem in the project to be
                         pulled if the user does not already have a
			 problem of the same name, or if the user's
			 problem of the same name
			 has no parent</td></tr>
<tr><td>re&#8209;pull</td><td>allows a problem in the project to be
                         pulled when an existing user problem
			 has the project problem as its parent
			 </td></tr>
<tr><td>view</td><td>makes the project visible; e.g., allows
                     project actions to be viewed in the View Page and
		     the project problems to be included in
		     the user's Favorites</td></tr>
<tr><td>move&#8209;from</td><td>allows problems to be moved from the project
                     (if move-to and re-push privileges allow)
		     </td></tr>
<tr><td>move&#8209;to</td><td>allows problems to be moved to the project
		      (if move-from and re-push privileges allow)
		      </td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
The following are the possible project problem privileges:
<table class='top-align'>
<tr><td>owner</td><td>allows user to edit the privileges of
                         the project problem</td></tr>
<tr><td>re&#8209;push</td><td>allows user to push a user problem
                              which has this project problem as its
			      parent; also allows a user to move
			      this project problem to another project
			      (if move-from and move-to
			      privileges allow)
                              </td></tr>
</table>
<p>
To determine privileges, lines in privilege files are processed in
the order
<ol>
<li> Superuser line: `+ owner $epm_superuser';
    here $epm_superuser is a parameter of the EPM Server, and
    is a regular expression that is matched with the current
    user ID to see if the current user has `owner' privileges
    for everything.
<li> project problem file lines, if the privileges
     of a project problem are being determined
     (as opposed to the privileges of just a project)
<li> project file lines
</ol>
<p>
A privilege file line is one of the following:
<ul>
<li> blank line; ignored
<li> comment line; first non-whitespace character is `#', ignored
<li> line of form `&lt;sign&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;matcher&gt;'
     <br>
     where
     <ul>
     <li> &lt;sign&gt; ::= `+' | `-'
     <li> &lt;key&gt; ::= &lt;privilege&gt; | &lt;group&gt;
     <li> &lt;matcher&gt; ::= &lt;regular-expression&gt; | &lt;group&gt;
     <li> &lt;privilege&gt; ::= `owner' | ... 
              <div style='margin-left:2em'>
	      where &lt;privilege&gt; must be appropriate for the file
	      it is in (e.g., `re-push' is appropriate for a project
	      problem file but not a project file)
	      </div>
     <li> &lt;group&gt; ::=
              <div style='margin-left:2em'>
	      sequence of letters, digits, `_', `-', and `@'
	      which begins with a `@' followed by a letter,
	      has only one `@' (at its beginning), and ends with
	      a letter or digit
	      </div>
     </ul>
     <br>
     If this line matches, the
     line assigns &lt;sign&gt; to &lt;key&gt; unless
     &lt;key&gt; has previously been assigned.
     <br>
     A &lt;regular-expression&gt; matches if it matches the
     current user ID.
     <br>
     A &lt;group&gt; matches if it has previously been assigned
     `+'.
</ul>
<p>
If after all the privilege file lines are processed a privilege
has the value `+', the current user has the privilege.  Otherwise
the current user does NOT have the privilege.
<p>
Groups may be defined that are sets of users, or are
intersections, unions, or
set complements of previous groups.
