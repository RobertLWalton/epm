<a name="login-page"><h1>Login Page</h1></a>

<p>The <b>login page</b> manages login using email addresses to
identify a user and confirmation numbers to create tickets for
the user in the user's browser.
</p>

<a name="login-email"><h2>User Email Address</h2></a>
<p>
Your <b>email address</b> serves as your account name,
and also as the place to which confirmation numbers
will be sent.
<p>
If you are making a new account, enter an appropriate
email address.
<p>
You can have up to 3 email addresses associated with
your account.  Its a good idea to have at least 2,
in case one is not working when you need it.
<p>
An account is on an <a name='EPM-server'><b>EPM server</b></a>.
EPM servers are named
by the document root URL used to access them, and EPM servers with
different names are independent of each other (even
if they are running on the same computer).
</p>

<a name="browser-ticket"><h2>Browser Ticket</h2></a>
<p>
A browser <b>ticket</b> is stored in the browser local memory
and enables a user to log in by giving only the email
address associated with ticket.  There is a separate
ticket for each <a href='#EPM-server'>EPM server</a>,
each email address of an account on that server, and each browser.
<p>
A ticket is created using a
<a name='confirmation-number'><b>confirmation number</b></a> sent to
the email address by the EPM server and copied from the email
into the browser by the user.  A ticket
expires after a certain interval: 2 days for the first ticket,
7 days for the second ticket, and 30 days for each
ticket thereafter.  In counting tickets, only <b>expired tickets</b>
are counted, so if you keep getting tickets before the previous
one expires, all your tickets will expire in the same number of days.
<p>
A confirmation number is only used during ticket creation, and
cannot be used to create more than one ticket.  It is not saved
by the EPM server or browser.
<p>
The `<b>Get New Ticket</b>' button removes the ticket for the
entered email address and <a href='#EPM-server'>EPM server name</a>
from the browser and returns to the initial
login page.
<p>
The `<b>Delete All Tickets</b>' button removes the <u>all</u>
tickets for the current EPM server from the browser and returns
to the initial login page.
</p>

<a name="user-page"><h1>User Page</h1></a>

<p>
To be an EPM user you must supply the following information which
appears on the user page.

<p class='indented'>
<mark>WARNING: All this information is PUBLIC in that it is
	       available to other users of the same EPM
	       server,
               except that email addresses will be abridged
	       when published by replacing characters
	       in them by dot(.) to prevent use by
	       unsophisticated robots.</mark>

<ul style='list-style-type:none'>
<li><h5>User ID</h5>:<p class='list'>
A short name by which you will be known.
Must consist of letters, digits, underline(_), and dash(-),
begin and end with a letter, and have at least 4 characters.
<li><h5>Full Name</h5>:<p class='list'>
Your full name, so that you can be looked up on the web.
<li><h5>Organization</h5>:<p class='list'>
The organization you are associated with, so you can be
looked up in the context of this organization.
Can be `Self', but only if you really have no organization.
<li><h5>Location</h5>:<p class='list'>
The location of your organization, e.g., town, state, and
country.
<li><h5>Email Addresses</h5>:<p class='list'>
You must have one or more email addresses associated with
your account.  You use these to log into the account.
It is well to have two or more, in case you lose access to
one of them.
</ul>
</p>


<a name="problem-page"><h1>Problem Page</h1></a>

<p>
At any given time you need to have a <b>current problem</b> you are working on.
The <b>problem page</b> allows you to create problems, select an
existing problem, and manage the current problem.
</p>


<a name="problem-names"><h2>Problem Names</h2></a>
<p>
A <a name='problem-name'><b>problem name</b></a>
can contain only letters, digits, and the
special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>).
In addition, it must begin and end with a letter.
</p>

<a name="problem-marks"><h2>Problem Marks</h2></a>
<p>
On the problem page:
<table style='margin-left:20px' class='top-align'>
<tr><td>&darr;</td><td>means `show below'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&uarr;</td><td>means `hide'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&Chi;</td><td>means `mark for deletion';
deletion does not occur until you `Delete Marked Files'
or upload or make a new file</td></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>means `remove deletion mark'</td></tr>
<tr><td>&rArr;</td><td>means `make a new file with given extension from the file named on the same line'</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<a name="current-problem-files"><h2>Current Problem Files</h2></a>
<p>
The <b>current problem files</b> are the files that you have uploaded
or created for the problem.  These files are stored in the problem
directory and can be viewed, used, or deleted.  They are displayed
in the `Current Problem File' table, one line per file.
<p>
Current problem <a name='file-names'><b>file names</b></a> must have particular
<a href='#file-extensions'>extensions</a> that specify their role within
the problem.  The rest of a file name can contain
only letters, digits, and the special characters dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>) and
underline(<pre.inline>_</pre>), must begin with a letter, and must
end with the <a href='#problem-name'>problem name</a>, which if it is
preceded by anything must be preceded by a
dash(<pre.inline>-</pre>).
<p>
Clicking on a file name, if it is a button,
will show the file with line numbers
in a separate window.
<p>
Clicking on &darr; will show the file below.
<p>
Files that are a single short line cannot be shown but their contents
are displayed in <pre.inline>{ }</pre> brackets at the end of the
file's line.
<p>
Empty files and binary files cannot be shown but their nature is
displayed at the end of the file's line.
<p>
Displayable files must be encoded in UTF-8 or PDF.
PDF files can only be displayed by clicking on the file name.
A UTF-8 file that is displayable has its number of lines indicated
at the end of the file's line.
Only if this number of lines is small enough does the file have
a &darr; that permits the file to be displayed below.
</p>

<a name="file-extensions"><h2>File Extensions</h2></a>
<p>
EPM files have <b>extensions</b> that indicate their format
and purpose.  In the following PPPP denotes the problem name
and XXXX denotes some other part of the name: for example,
the name XXXX-PPPP.in matches the name `00-001-reverser.in'
if XXXX is 00-001 and PPPP is `reverser'.

<a name="problem-commands"><h2>Commands Last Executed</h2></a>
<p>
This section displays the UNIX/POSIX/LINUX commands last executed
to make a file, and if any files output by these commands are
kept in the problem directory, a list of kept files is also displayed.
<p>
Included is the CPU execution time in 0.001 second units of some of the
command lines.
<p>
If a command line fails, this is indicated along with a failure
message (but not for debugging runs that make .dout files which
contain their own failure messages, if any).
</p>

<a name="problem-working"><h2>Working Files of Last Executed Commands</h2></a>
<p>
This section lists the files made by the last executed commands
which were <u>not</u> kept.  These files can be displayed in the
same manner as the files in the files in the
<a href="#current-problem-files">Current Problem Files</a>
section.
<p>
Files that are kept on successful uploads or makes will
remain as (usually non-empty)
working files on unsuccessful uploads or makes.
<p>
Working files are deleted when a new set of commands is executed
or when a .run file is run.
</p>

<a name="run-page"><h1>Run Page</h1></a>

<a name="option-page"><h1>Option Page</h1></a>

<p>The <b>option page</b> shows the options given to
commands that perform compilations and computations,
and allows you to edit these within limits.
<p>
For example, the allowed maximum size of the virtual memory
when a problem solution program is executing is an
option, as is the allowed maximum size of any file output
by the solution.
<p>
The commands used to make one file from another are specified
by <a href='#templates'><b>templates</b></a>.
The template selected for a particular
task is controled by the extensions of the input and output
files and by what other files are available (for example,
if a .class file is available a template invoking JAVA will
be used, whereas if a .pyc file is available, a template invoking
PYTHON will be used).
<p>
There are two values for each option: an <b>inherited value</b>
and a <b>local value</b>.  The inherited value is set by
the <a href='#ancestors'><b>ancestors</b></a> of the current problem,
and cannot be changed (without changing the options files in the
ancestors).  The local value, when given, replaces the inherited value.
In displays, local values are colored green and inherited values
are colored tan.
<p>
As with other pages, clicking on a &uarr; will hide a section
of the page and clicking on a &darr; will display the section.
</p>

<a name="option-values"><h2>Option Values</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Option values</b> are numbers included in command
options.  If you edit an inherited option, its value will
turn green, even if you input the same value as the inherited
value.  Clicking the &#8635; symbol after the value will restore
the value to the inherited value (and restore the color to tan).

For example, the STIME option value is the maximum number of
CPU seconds allowed a problem solution program.
</p>

<a name="option-arguments"><h2>Option Command Arguments</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Option command arguments</b> are the actual arguments that
are inserted into template commands.  For each such option there
are discrete choices.
<p>
<a href='#option-values'>Option values</a>
are inserted into option command arguments.  For example,
the STIME option value argument is inserted into the
`-cputime STIME' option command argument which can then
be inserted into the command that runs the solution program,
so that the options work together with the command to determine
the maximum number of CPU seconds
allowed the solution program.
<p>
The absence of a value for an option command argument is represented by
an empty box.
If there are two colored boxes, the
one colored green is the current value and is local, and the one
colored tan is inherited.
If only one box is colored,
the option value is inherited, even if the box is colored green
(which just means that you have clicked on the inherited value).
</p>

<a name="option-templates"><h2>Template Commands</h2></a>
<p>
<b>Template commands</b> are available on this page so that
you may see how option command arguments are inserted into
commands.
<p>
Clicking on &#9734; will display the commands of a template and
clicking on &#9733; will hide them.  The commands are standard
POSIX commands into which substitutions have been made.  In
addition to option command argument substitutions, the problem
name is substituted for PPPP, and the reminder of the file names
is substituted for other sequences of 4 consecutive capital
letters, such as XXXX or YYYY.
